The Refuge universe spans several hundred years of future history, from the near-destruction of the human race during the Massacre at Earth, to humanity’s campaign of conquest in the First Terran War, to the holocaust at Avis and the opening years of the Great War between Ienet and the IFS.

# Early human colonization
In the beginning of the twenty-second century, the first pioneers into the vast expanses of space left Earth in search of new inhabitable systems and planets. This blind, grasping exploration sowed the seeds for the catastrophic devastation of Earth in 2237 CE, an event colloquially known as The Massacre.

A large strike force of Tau OBPs arrived at Earth on the 26th of July in 2237 CE, having previously encountered belligerent human colonies on Aile, in an attempt to eradicate the fledgling interstellar power. The vast majority of Earth’s population was killed in the initial orbital bombardment. Fewer than two million survived, and the United Nations immediately began efforts to leave the environmentally-devastated planet.

Made possible by the massive and unharmed fleet of mining craft in orbit around the gas giants, the Exodus from Earth was quickly initiated. Hundreds of thousands of survivors were evacuated from the planet over the next eight years, beginning with the First Exodus in 1 MR and terminating in 8 MR with the final relocations to Icre. Upon establishing an industrial presence on the planet, preparations were rapidly made for a violent confrontation with the forces that had sought to destroy humanity.

# First Terran War
The first wide-scale engagement with exies, a pejorative abbreviation of “extraterrestrial,” occured in 21 MR, with the First Battle of Meyek Prime. A vicious series of hit-and-run military strikes upon the planet secured the planet’s unwilling cooperation in the greater conflict. The human forces established a Terran Federation of Systems with the inhabitants of Meyek Prime and Avis and immediately lashed out at the Tau in the bloody, retributive First Battle of Tau-11. The Tau surrendered in the face of a planet-wide assault with both thermonuclear and orbital kinetic weapons.

With only the waning First Solari Empire and the Amas remaining as threatening interstellar powers, the TFS regrouped and quickly moved to Solari Theta in what came to be known as the Great Siege. The FSE surrendered in the face of a potential thermonuclear bombardment like the one that befallen the Tau.

In 23 MR, the TFS moved to engage the Amas in the climactic  First Battle of Amas, which ended in a painful rout for the Amas. The extraterrestrial interstellar powers were subdued, more due to the shock of such a violent, maurading force, and the TFS, now with the tacit agreement of the inhabitants of Amas, Solari Theta, Tau, Meyek and Avis, reformed as the Intergalactic Federation of Systems with the forces of humanity at its head.

# Early IFS dominance
The first years of Terran control over the galaxy were marked by rapid expansion by human forces and a consolidation of human interests in known space. The Amas and Tau attempted to recover from the devastating IFS attacks during the First Terran War, and the IFS presence on Solari precluded a reassertion of FSE power. The IFS’s relationship with the Avis and the residents of Meyek was far more cordial, and offered the IFS their only major allies.

In 27 MR, the Tau began demanding reparation for the First Battle of Tau-11, a claim that was dismissed by the IFS, setting the stage for the Tau Insurrection in 46 MR. The Eza Syndicate first makes an appearance on the Federation stage in an infamous piracy incident, but disappeared almost immediately.

# Tau Insurrection
Twenty-five years after the conclusion of the First Terran War, the Tau sent a strike force to Aile and held a colony of two hundred humans hostages, and demanding recognized independence from the IFS and threatening execution of the hostages. An attempted rescue operation on the part of the IFS failed catastrophically, and both the members of the rescue
operation and the hostages were executed by the Tau.

Both Amas and Olea quickly joined the Tau’s cause. With few supporters, and no independent human allies to speak of, the IFS requests military assistance from the Eza Syndicate in exchange for legal recognition. The Eza Syndicate quickly secured surrender from Amas, and Olea follows several weeks later with the help of a local arms group, the Olea Corporation.
The IFS reaches Tau -11in the last months of 46 MR. A strong ground defense prevented the IFS from pursuing another bombardment, and the Tau retreated to the planet’s surface after two days’ fighting in orbit.

Geological and climate activity on Tau-11 was at a high point, making fighting particularly difficult for the IFS’s largely human ground forces. They suffered heavy casualties, but managed to destroy enough of the ground defenses to permit an orbital assault. They withdrew without warning and began to carpetbomb the planet with thermonuclear weapons. The Tau surrendered within hours of the first barrages.

# Peace and Stability
A relatively vast expanse of time during which there were no major conflicts. The usually-belligerent Tau remained quiet and made little overt opposition to IFS  authority. While the IFS remained largely human-centric, it began to reach out to the Amas and Avis, with varying levels of success. Meyek Prime bcame an important cultural center, representing perhaps the greatest cooperation between humans and exies seen. All in all, the galaxy saw a time of great technological and cultural advance.

# Second Terran War
In 116 MR, a highly virulent strain of Variola was introduced to the human population of Meyek Prime. The virus spread rapidly through the human population, and those humans who did not immediately perish left the planet.

Within a year, the epidemic had been traced to a vocally anti-human and anti-IFS organization based on the nearby Avis.

The IFS, in an attempt to prevent another crisis like the Tau Insurrection, immediately declared martial law on both Icre and Avis, an action that was faced with immediate, violent revolution. Nearly all members of the IFS political authority in the system were executed, and the IFS military routed. The human populace was split, with some quickly taking steps to move offworld, with others fully supporting the revolutionary governments.

The Tau, left the IFS weeks after entering talks with the newly-formed Interim Republics of Icre/Avis (IRIA). The IFS quickly moved to threaten Tau-11 with an invasion force, only to be rebuffed by the combined forces of the IRIA and Tau, armed  with a number of planetary EMP cannons. The IFS craft were quickly disabled and destroyed.

The catastrophic Third Battle of Tau-11 started a chain of secession: the Amas seceded, followed quickly by the Aile and Keth systems. The IRIA, along with the Tau and new systems, formed the Second Insurrection, or SI.

Again summoning the assistance of the Eza Syndicate to disrupt SI supply lines, the IFS began scouting outlying planetary systems for military resources while refraining from engaging in direct conflict with the SI.

Their limited expansionary success—Caal, Ulread, Ienet and Selus joined the IFS ranks and began to be populated by colonists—did not prevent Renve from seceding after an Eza attack upon a passenger craft less than a year later.

The first major break in the temporary peace between the SI and IFS took place at Telren, the sole IFS stronghold between the SI and Solari Theta.The Siege of Telren took place over a year, a nearly-continuous blockade of the planet broken only by sporadic appearances of IFS and Eza fleets in attempts to deliver supplies and break the blockade. After the year and with no surrender from Telren, the SI invaded. The colonists were miraculously able to rebuff the SI, and were rescued with the timely appearance of a well-armed IFS fleet.

In 122 MR, the SI broke through at Alcesar, capturing the planet at an enormous risk. Alcesar sat between the two spheres of influence the IFS possessed - the first, centered at Solari Theta and encompassing its immediate surroundings and its larger sphere of territorial influence in the mining sector. Alcesar quickly became a SI stronghold- the already present industrial strength resulted in its being put to use as another industrial center, as well as a chokepoint for IFS trade lanes. The IFS, at the urging of Eza, began to adopt hit-and-run tactics - striking at trade routes and even destroying civilian targets. Telren was established as a foothold for the IFS within SI territory, and Alcesar was established by the SI as a foothold in the IFS’s.

Land campaigns quickly became the new format of war - ground-to-space technology had advanced too quickly to make sustained orbit bombardments an effective option against heavily industrialized worlds.

The Eza Syndicate managed to break through with a lengthy series of land battles on Keth, liberating the planet and leaving Solari Theta undefended against only Alcesar and Icre/Avis. The SI began a length siege of Caal in an attempt to capture one of the more valuable planets of the mining sector. The IFS, sensing the SI’s preocupation with its attack on Caal, lashed out at Alcesar in 122 in an attempt to recapture it. The misguided attack failed dramatically, with a relatively small group of SI cruisers and carriers managing to beat back the IFS attack fleet.

The IFS sent another attack fleet in 123, again failing to break the enemy lines. Late in 123 the SI, after sending a large fleet to bolster their already-present forces at Caal, managed to capture it within the time frame of several extensive battles. The IFS struck again at Alcesar, capturing it in a show of military might. After successfully capturing Alcesar, the IFS sent a fleet of orbital bombardment platforms to Caal.

The attack fleet opened fire on the planet with the assistance of eight new Advent Horizon-class frigates armed with superheavy rotary Gauss cannons. The land forces of Caal were almost entirely decimated. The sheer brutality of the attack triggered geological activity on the surface, sparking several earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. With Caal suitably pacified, the IFS regrouped at Telren and prepared to strike out at the weakened SI.

The Eza Syndicate turned against the IFS in early 125 before news of the loss of Alcesar had reached the ears of the mercenary guild. It has been suggested that in exchange for assistance from the Eza Syndicate, the SI had indicated its willingness to offer the Syndicate control over several planets—likely Keth and Ulread—following the dismantling of the IFS.
By 125, the Second Terran War had reached a temporary stalemate. It would take a massive campaign on either side to take even a single of the border worlds, and the resources of the IFS and SI were too few to carry out the attempt.

It was only with a long-term IFS covert operation on Avis’ surface involving some of the humans who had elected to stay on the planet following its secession and initiated by the infamously ruthless and newly-promoted Admiral Hermann Koch, that the IFS was able to open up a momentary window in the SI’s planetary defense systems.

No orbital defenses were active when twelve Advent Horizon-class cruisers arrived at Icre, flanked with several IFS battlecruisers and dozens of smaller craft. Virtually every living thing on the surface of Avis was killed in the thermonuclear fire that consumed the planet’s surface. The massive civilian and military casualties, including virtually the entire SI command hierarchy, resulted in the dissolution of the SI immediately after word of the obliteration reached the ears of other SI member systems. All were reintegrated with the IFS in 127, marking the end of the Second Terran War.

The treacherous Eza Syndicate was outlawed, but political attentions were turned to reconstruction rather than destroying the Syndicate. The Terran Wars were over, and the IFS’s control over the galaxy was solidified.

# The Great Calm
After the horrifying bloodshed of the Second Terran War, the galaxy enjoyed a period of relative calm and reconstruction. Despite grumblings and the occasional minor insurrection from the planets subjugated under a solidified IFS hegemony,

# The Great War
As the Refuge RPG proper takes place in the opening days of The Great War, the remainder of the chapter primarily concerns the people, places, technology and events surrounding the year 270 MR.
