There are dozens of major corporations throughout known space that manufacture equipment for both profit, political and social clout and technological achievement. Several of the larger ones are vast organizations that run entire planets and serves as governing bodies of their own, while others have fit into niches as their fortunes have waxed and waned.

**Alliance Defense:** The Tau Alliance’s nationalized fabrication plants produce extremely accurate and powerful weapons. They are not, however, built with human users in mind - Alliance Defense firearms have staggering recoil and abysmal ergonomics.

**Eberhard & Stafford**: Eberhard & Stafford have produced top-tier weapons since the Second Terran War. Their reputation for high-power, accurate, ergonomic and controllable firearms comes at a cost - E&S products are extremely expensive.

**Ienet Defense Materials:** Ienet Defense Materials produces high-damage, accurate and cheap weapons. However, they tend to fire slowly and nearly uncontrollable when firing automatically.

**IFSF:** IFS Fabrication produces middle-of-the-road weapons befitting the IFS military ethos, with middling damage and low accuracy.

**Imperium Arms:** Only one of the Amasian firearms manufacturers exports to non-Amasian markets, the venerable Imperium Arms. Its weapons are sleek, controllable and powerful, but are fairly expensive and fire slowly.

**Paragon Horizon, Inc.:** A fairly new manufacturer founded by a , PH produces extremely adequate firearms. PH firearms fire quickly with controllable recoil, but are otherwise unspectacular.

**Olea Corporation:** The majority of the Olea Corporation’s weapons and products are marketed to civilians; its weapons are accordingly cheap and user-friendly. They are relatively ineffectual, fairly inaccurate and as such, more or less unusable for military purposes.

**Strelnikov Mechanical:** Founded by a long-line of firearms makers, Strelnikov’s weapons are cheap and powerful, with otherwise middling performance.

**Vasquez Fabrication:** Though more well-known for their ammunition, VF manufactures a small collection of premium-quality, match-grade weapons - powerful and accurate weapons with good ergonomics, but high cost and poor controllability.
