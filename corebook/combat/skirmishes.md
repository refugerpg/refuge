The first section of this chapter is dedicated to a description of most situations encountered over the course of general infantry combat. Vehicular and craft-to-craft combat is covered in the second section of this chapter.

## Determining initiative
Initiative dictates the order in which characters participate in combat. In a situation when the opposing forces are aware of the other's presence, initiative is determined by an Agility roll (d10 plus the character's Agility score), and combat order follows the order of rolls—from the highest roll first to lowest roll last. In the event that some combatants are unaware of the others' presence, combat order can be determined freely by the ambushing force, while the ambushed force must roll for initiative and join combat after the attacking characters. Characters that join combat in-progress join at the end of the current combat round.

## Taking turns
Unlike many role-playing games, actions are chosen simultaneously, and executed in order of initiative. This allows for all players to do their number crunching at the same time. If a player’s target is eliminated during a turn, it’s simply bad luck.

## Action Points
At the beginning of each character's segment of the combat round—their turn—he or she receives Action Points to perform actions. Action Points can be used to move, attack or use an ability. When a character has exhausted his or her supply of Action Points, his or her turn is over.

Should a character choose to perform an action requiring more than his or her total number of action points, the character can elect to perform the action at the beginning of the current round, and is prevented from acting again until the number of actions points have been passed.

## Starting combat
In order to participate in combat, a character must have a weapon equipped. The AP cost for this action is variable, depending on the weight and size of the weapon. When a weapon is drawn, they are then able to attack. Obviously, Unarmed combat requires nothing to be equipped.

## Movement
A character can move during any part of his or turn, provided he or she has the required AP to perform the action. Movement to an adjacent square requires 3 AP, while movement to a square diagonal from his or her current square costs 4.

Movement over rough terrain (harsh slopes, uneven ground, etc.) incurs a +2 penalty to the typical AP cost for movement (adjacent movement now requires 4, diagonal 5).
Moving from a standing position to a crouch (or vice versa) costs 2 AP, moving from a crouch to prone (or vice versa) costs 2 AP, and moving from a standing position to a prone position (again, or vice versa) costs 4 AP.

Walking over smooth terrain imparts no penalties to attacks taken in the same turn. However, a variety of actions do, and other actions provide bonuses. Running and walking over rough terrain impart -3 and -2 penalties to all attacks within the character’s turn, respectively. Dropping flat, an extremely brief action, imparts a -3 penalty to all further attacks made in the character’s turn.

Crouching and lying prone provide +1 and +2 bonuses to all Aim checks, respectively. Characters must stop moving before being able to attack, unless they have selected the Shot on the Run Ability (for Aim checks) or Attack on the Run Ability (for Mêlée Weapons/Unarmed Combat checks).

**Example:** Hollis, level six Spacer, finds himself attempting to infiltrate a small warehouse. Hollis, with 10 AP, walks the last meter (-3 AP) up the alley to the front corner of the warehouse. He unholsters his pistol (-3 AP), leans out (-2 AP) and sees an Olea trooper leaning back against the wall, smoking a cigarette and not paying particular attention. He leans back (-2 AP) and waits for the trooper to continue his patrol.

## Attacking and defending
Attacking during the combat round is a matter of rolling for the skill which the character intends to use. Attacking with a firearm requires an Aim roll, attacking with a mêlée weapon a Mêlée Combat roll, and a punch or kick a Unarmed Combat roll. Any attack can be defended against with a Dodge roll, while Mêlée Combat and Unarmed Combat rolls can also be defended against with their respective skills.

{{% example %}}
**Example:** Hollis attacks the Olea trooper with his E&S '63 Custom. Hollis, with 5 points of AP left, aims for a +2 bonus to attack, and fires. He rolls a 4 on his d10. With the cumulative +0 attack modifier (+2 aim bonus, -2 base accuracy), his Aim score of 7 (6, with a Dexterity modifier of +1) leaves him with a total attack of 11. The trooper dodges, rolling a 5, but his middling Dodge and Agility modifiers (4 and +0, respectively) score leaves his final defense roll a 9. Hollis hits.

Failed attacks do not generally result in repercussions for the attacker—situations in which the defender has the Ability Riposte excepted. A successful attack, that is when the combined roll of the attacker exceeds that of the defender, is followed by damage calculation.

## Unarmed attacks
Since “unarmed” attacks are by definition without weapons, AP costs and damage for unarmed attacks are not dependent on a particular item, they are simply dictated by a character’s attribute and skill scores.

## Modifiers
The circumstances surrounding an attack can be modified in several ways by characters. The most common method is by aiming one's weapon. Firing at the hip is not an especially accurate way of using a firearm, and substantial penalties to accuracy when firing in such a manner reflect that.

All weapons have a base accuracy, and a maximum aimed accuracy. Some smaller weapons, such as pistols and SMGs, receive only minor benefits from being aimed, while larger weapons designed for greater ranges, such as assault rifles and light machine guns, receive much greater benefits. The accuracy bonus applied to an attack is directly correlated with the amount of AP spent aiming the weapon, but only until the AP cost to achieve the maximum aimed accuracy is reached.

Characters with the Quick Aim ability are able to reach the maximum aimed accuracy of their weapons faster. Accuracy modifiers are retained throughout the rest of the turn unless the attacking character performs an action that reorients the weapon (reloading, operating an underslung weapon, a mêlée strike, etc.).

{{% example %}}
**Example:** Hollis's E&S '63 Custom, a rather bulky ballistic pistol, is not a particularly accurate weapon, with a base accuracy of -2. It does, however, receive a relatively substantial bonus when being aimed, with a maximum aimed bonus of +4. Now, were Hollis to aim his pistol for the maximum accuracy of +4, the additional AP cost to his attack would be +6.

A somewhat less common method of modifying one's attack is through the use of hit locations. Each body part has its own specific modifier when attempting to specifically hit it, reflecting the added difficulty of hitting a target's head or arm instead of its center of mass. All shots with no hit location specified are assumed to be directed toward the torso (+0 attack modifier). Attacking specific body parts is most helpful when attempting to score Critical Hits against targets (see 2.6, Critical Hits).

{{% example %}}
**Example:** Perhaps Hollis instead had aimed for the trooper's head. With a roll of four on his d10, a +0 weapon accuracy modifier, +7 Aim and a -3 penalty for hit location, Hollis's attack roll is a total of 8. Despite the soldier's middling Dodge and Agility modifier, his defense roll of 9 allows him to dodge Hollis's attack.

At long ranges, range can also have an effect on an attack roll. Beyond the maximum range of a weapon, all attacks incur a -5 penalty.

## Rate of fire and weapon spread
Every successful attach results in at least one hit against an opponent. A particularly successful attack roll, or a particularly abysmal defensive roll on the part of the defender, can result in multiple hits. An average between a weapon's recoil and fire dispersion, weapon spread determines the probability of successive hits. Every time the difference between an attack and defense roll exceeds a weapon's spread score, up through the weapon's maximum rate of fire, another hit occurs.

{{% example %}}
**Example:** In an alternate universe, the Olea soldier opens up a tear of automatic fire with his rifle (ROF 8, spread 4). He rolls Aim 7, adds +7 skill/circumstantial modifiers and comes up with a total of 14. Hollis, try as he might, only manages to come up with 9 Dodge, and is hit twice (at 14 and at 10). Hollis has found himself in a world of hurt.

## Damage
The number of hits on an enemy and the subsequent damage done are determined by pair of dice rolls. Upon a successful hit, the attacker's roll is compared with the defender's. Every number of points equal to the attacker's weapon's spread score results in additional hit, and another damage roll.

Damage is determined by rolling the weapon damage indicated for the particular weapon in use. 3d8 damage yields anything from 3 to 24 damage, etc. This damage is then applied to the damage resistance of the target. All armor provides some damage resistance to at least one of the six damage types (see table). After damage is calculated, the damage inflicted is subtracted from the relevant damage resistance of the target's armor.

{{% example %}}
**Example:** Luckily, Hollis didn’t bite off more than he could chew. Having successfully hit the Olea trooper, he rolls for damage. His E&S '63 Custom has a damage rating of 2d6. He rolls for 7 ballistic damage. The trooper's light armor soaks up 3 points of damage, but takes the other 4 points as damage to his total HP.

## Suppressive Fire
For characters with the Suppressive Fire ability, suppressive fire as a full-round action is a viable tactical option. The attacking character makes a single attack roll with no aiming bonus on a circle with a diameter of 3, 5 or 7 squares, depending on the ability rank. All characters in the target circle must Dodge. A successful roll pins the suppressed character to a prone position. A failed roll hits the suppressed character and then pins him or her to a prone position.
Any attempt to break suppression requires a Willpower roll vs. the suppressing character’s Aim roll. A failed roll results in the character remaining prone. After a successful roll the suppressed character makes a Dodge roll to avoid the fire, and a further success allows them to move and operate normally.

## Overwatch
Characters with the Overwatch Ability are able to spend half their turn’s AP in watching down a 45˚ sightline. When an enemy moves into the sightline, the character can use the other half of their turn to make an action of their choice.

## Morale
At the beginning of a combat encounter, morale is calculated (for the player characters, this will not change dramatically between encounters) for each group of opposing combatants by adding each character’s morale score together.

As characters are rendered unconscious or killed, the group’s morale drops accordingly, and half the points they contributed to their own morale pool is redirected toward the opposing force’s. Individuals in groups with low morale suffer penalties to their skill rolls.

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Group morale</th><th>Morale modifier</th></tr>
<tr><td>175%+</td><td>+5</td></tr>
<tr><td>150% - 175%</td><td>+3</td></tr>
<tr><td>125% - 150%</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>75% - 125%</td><td>+0</td></tr>
<tr><td>50% - 75%</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>25% - 50%</td><td>-3</td></tr>
<tr><td>0% - 25%</td><td>-5</td></tr>

# Conditions
Characters can be subject to a number of conditions.

# Cover and Concealment
When under fire, characters receive considerable bonuses to their Dodge rolls when they are behind cover. And while concealment does not offer any substantive protection against attacks, it does make a prospective assailant's job a good deal harder. Characters attacking a concealed opponent—one hiding in brush, behind penetrable materials, in darkness—receive penalties to attack rolls.

# Death, Dying & Revival
A character reduced to 0 HP is immediately knocked unconscious, and stabilizes, taking no further damage nor facing any immediate fear of death. They are, however, incapacitated until they are revived by an ally with a DS 20 Heal check, and a subsequent DS 25 Heal check to revive at 1 HP. (A failed Heal check of either raises its DS for subsequent checks by 5.) A character reduced to negative HP is considered dying, and will continue losing HP at -1 per round until stabilized by an ally. When a character's HP reaches the negative equivalent of their Constitution score, they are dead, as is a character with a Constitution score of zero. A dead character can only be revived in extremely rare circumstances.
## Example skirmish
{{% example %}}
Maire Jensen (Scout 5) is in a spot of trouble. Trapped a hangar with a pair of hostile, stimrunning thugs and armed only with her trusty Thensi SMG, things don’t look good.
An enemy Support leans out from behind a crate and lets out a tear of suppressive fire. He rolls 10  (8 + Aim 7 + Dexterity mod. -1 + -4 LMG base aim penalty). Maire musters the willpower to weather the burst, rolling a 15 (9 + 6 Willpower + Intelligence mod. 0). With such a high Dodge score, (Dodge 7 + Agility mod. 3) she is able to avoid the burst of suppressing fire by default.

She sprints behind a nearby shipping crate (-7 AP), leans out, (-2 AP) and aims for a moment (-1 AP, +1 Aim modifier), and carefully squeezes of a burst at the enemy Support. (-4 AP). She rolls a 6, adds her Aim +8 and Dexterity mod. of +0 and subtracts the -3 accuracy penalty for a total attack roll of 12.

The enemy Support is a slow, lumbering fellow. He rolls a 5, adds Dodge 3 and subtracts a -1 Agility mod. for a total of 7. As her Aim roll exceeds the defender’s Dodge roll by her weapon’s spread score (3), she earns another hit.

The submachine gun does 3d12 damage; Maire rolls 4 + 9 + 12 = 25 and 6 + 7 + 9 = 22. The Support’s heavy armor (+30 Ballistic) negates the first shot, but with the damage stacking vs . She’ll need something a little heavier to deal with him

The enemy Soldier waits at his position and sets up overwatch, waiting for her to step out from behind the crate: he gets to use the other half of his turn at a point of his choosing.

The Support lets up on the suppressing fire and ducks down, receiving total cover. With no visible targets and a Soldier waiting for her, Maire unclips a grenade from her belt and throws it between the two soldiers. The point she throws at is 10 meters away, requiring a Demolitions roll of 10 to hit precisely. She rolls a six, but without Demolitions as a class skill or any invested points, she receives only half her Dexterity modifer for the throw (luckily for us it’s zero, so we don’t have to do any calculations).

Rolling 1d10 for miss direction, the grenade lands four meters to the left of where she intended, right at the feet of the Support. With 5d20 points of Shock damage from the high explosive grenade, the enemy Support takes 28 damage. (16 +3 + 15 +12 + 12 = 58 - 30 Shock DR = 28. Counting from the inside to the outside, this also inflicts 12 damage on the enemy Soldier, who merely shrugs it off.)

Twenty-eight damage kills the Support outright. The eight points of morale contributed by the Support to their morale pool is removed, leaving the Soldier demoralized and suffering a -1 penalty to all further checks. Maire, on the other hand, is bolstered by her foe’s demise and receives a +1 morale bonus. Maire sprints with her 10 remaining AP to the crate before the Support’s corpse, but the Soldier strikes from his waiting position. He rolls a 16 (8 + Aim 5 + Dexterity mod. 4 - morale 1), and Maire fails to dodge the initial shot, but he misses with the rest of his burst. He rolls 6 + 5 + 2 + 7+ 8 = 28. Maire’s light armor absorbs 15 points of the damage, but she takes 13 points of damage to her HP.

Looks like things just got worse...
