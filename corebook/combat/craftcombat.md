By and large, combat in space is identical to infantry combat. Initiative, action points, movement, attacking, dodging, etc. all operate similarly to infantry combat. The intent for the Refuge Role-Playing Game is not to portray space combat realistically. Inertia will not be accounted for, nor will 3D combat. See Appendix PLACEHOLDER: Tactical Space Combat for an alternate system for craft combat that does attempt to offer a semi-realistic combat ruleset.

# Combat Scale

## Damage
Damage done between craft is a factor of ten greater than damage done between infantry combatants. Any damage to a craft done by small arms are divided by ten, and any damage done by a craft to individuals are multiplied by ten. And as repairing any major structural damage to a craft is basically impossible on the part of an individual, any hit points restored to a craft by a PC or NPC are restored at 10% of the rolled rate.

## Initiative & Turns
Initiative is determined both for craft and for the crew of the player characters’ craft in combat. Craft take turns based on their initiative roll - d10 + Agility - and during a craft’s turn, all characters in the craft take action as they choose.
Boarding parties who are detected as they arrive roll for initiative when entering a craft and join at the end of the round. Boarding parties whose craft is not detected—arriving undetected at a craft with functioning sensors would be something of a miracle—arrive as an ambushing force, and as such, are able to freely determine initiative and enter combat at the beginning of the round.

# Crew Actions
Crew can take a number of actions during the craft’s turn.

## Moving and attacking within craft
Moving and attacking within a craft occurs exactly as it does in infantry combat. Zero-gravity is treated as rough terrain for the purposes of movement AP.

## Stations
“Stations” is simply in reference to a dedicated role a character is playing in a craft at a given time. A pilot is typically piloting, engineer repairing, navigator navigating, &c. The number of actions a character is able to take over the course of their turn at a station is dictated by the character’s AP.
There are no penalties for a character taking a station they’re typically not assigned to, other than their generally lesser aptitude for the task than the one who would ordinarily be taking the role.

Rolls made at stations that make use of a craft’s innate characteristics and skills - movement, accuracy, sensor quality, &c. - are as follows:
d10 + Character Skill + Craft Skill + Craft Attribute modifier.

The physical and ‘intellectual’ limitations and graces of a character do not affect the performance of a craft - only their skill at the particular duty they’re performing. Rolls made at stations that do not make use of a craft’s innate characteristics - typically repair - use the traditional opposed or unopposed skill roll.

### Cockpit
The pilot’s role is to control the craft and make any decisions related to its movement, and in the absence of a dedicated gunner, combat actions. As attacks made from the cockpit do not involve actual manual control of weapons, are made using the pilot’s Pilot skill and the craft’s Aim skill:
{{% example %}}
d10 + Pilot’s Pilot + Craft’s Aim + Craft’s Dexterity modifier
{{% /example %}}

When taking fire, a craft is often forced to make Dodge rolls. Dodge rolls for craft are made using a character’s Pilot skill and the craft’s Dodge skill.

Example: Hollis, piloting the shiny new craft he acquired in the last chapter, is being harassed by pirates. In the absence of a gunner, he opts to take aim with his craftboard weapons. Hollis, as noted earlier in the chapter, has 10 AP. He moves his craft two squares to the right, for four AP, and fires on one of the enemy pirates with his missile launchers. He rolls a 4 on his d10, adds his 9 Pilot score, adds his craft’s 6 ranks in Aim and +1 modifier to Dexterity for a total of 20.

### Sensors
Having a character manning the sensors can offer considerable bonuses to its use - often, a good deal of interpretation is required in reading sensor outputs, the sort of interpretation computers are not quite as gifted at as sentient creatures. The skill roll is as follows:
{{% example %}}
d10 + Navigator’s Awareness + Craft’s Awareness + Craft’s Perception modifier
{{% /example %}}

### AMD
For a craft attempting to make an AMD jump, having a crew member on the navigation console is necessary. This action operates as a traditional unopposed skill check. See Chapter Seven: Vehicles & Craft for more information on AMD operation.
{{% example %}}
d10 + Navigator’s Navigate + Character’s Perception modifier vs. AMD DS
{{% /example %}}

### Weapons
Rarely are pilots able to pilot a craft and accurately put out fire against enemies simultaneously. Other crew members can man craftboard guns to maximize a craft’s damage output. The bene As stated earlier, these all operate as Heavy Weapons for the purpose of weapon proficiencies. As targeting systems are a fairly integral part of craftboard weapons operation, characters manning weapons use a craft’s Aim roll and Dexterity bonus on top of their own Aim roll.
{{% example %}}
d10 + Gunner’s Aim + Craft’s Aim + Craft’s Dexterity modifier
{{% /example %}}

### Repair
Internal systems for craft are notoriously fragile, and having an engineer onboard to repair damaged systems can be critical to a crew’s survival. Every round an onboard engineer can repair one-tenth of the following hit points per round, rounded up.
{{% example %}}
d10 + Engineer’s Engineering + Engineer’s Intelligence modifier
{{% /example %}}

# Victory conditions
In space combat, it’s uncommon that an enemy craft will be destroyed outright. Often, a craft’s heat sinks will overheat before they either receive a killing blow from or deal one to another craft. When a craft’s heat sinks are unable to further compensate for combat conditions, its crew traditionally extends radiators as a signal of surrender.
Heat sinks & combat

All craft built for combat, and even some of those that aren’t, will have integral heat sinks to absorb some of the heat usage in the craft. These operate similarly to a secondary HP pool, though instead of enemy craft depleting that secondary HP, a craft’s own thermal expenditures do. Using lasers and Gauss firearms produce heat, as do AMDs, life support systems, thrusters, reactors and virtually any other electrically-powered system in craft. The saving grace of ballistics is the

A key element of craft-to-craft combat is the use of heat sinks. Radiators, while extremely adept in evacuating waste heat, are also shrieking targets for enemy infrared missile locks. And without radiators a craft and its crew are as good as dead.

A craft that extends its radiators in the course of combat is waving its proverbial white flag. Few honorable captains would attack a surrendering opponent, but few have the luxury of honor.
