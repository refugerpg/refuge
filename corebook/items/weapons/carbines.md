**Olea G24C:** A consumer-grade Olea Corporation Gauss carbine. Mass produced to lower costs, it is without question the cheapest production Gauss longarm available to the general public. As a civilian weapon, it fires at much lower velocities - and inflicts much less damage - than an equivalent military or match-grade weapon.
