A number of different pistols and models are available from weapons manufacturers. Most are capable of dropping an unarmored target within a single hit, and as such, are formidable and widely accessible personal defense weapons.

**Eberhard & Stafford ‘59 Special**: Widely considered to be among the best Gauss pistols ever created by the legendary weapons manufacturer, the Eberhard & Stafford ‘59 Special displays a nearly-perfect balance of damage, power consumption and reliability. The only obstacle that remains to most would-be buyers is the price. Even used specimens are  expensive and difficult to obtain.

**Eberhard & Stafford ‘63 Custom:** While clumsier and less reliable than an E&S Gauss firearm, the E&S ‘63 Custom is capable of higher damage output, contains a larger magazine and does not suffer the overheating problems that can plague Eberhard & Stafford’s older premium models.

**IFS Fabrication M6**: The service pistol of most service members of the IFS Armed Forces, the M6 is a cheap automatic pistol. Firing in a two-round burst with a unique mechanism that delays perceived recoil for the shooter, the M6 capable of dishing out considerable damage within a short time frame.

**Vasquez Fabrication Striker:** A devastating handgun capable of downing even a Tau within a handful of shots, the Vasquez Fabrication Striker is accurate, powerful and ergonomic.

**Alliance Defense Defiler (Exie):** Firing a small intermediate (i.e. rifle) round, the Defiler is a repeater handgun built by and for the Tau. Large-framed, large-bored and brutally efficient, the Defiler is the preferred sidearm for Tau warriors seeking a piece from home.
