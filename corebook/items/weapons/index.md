Pistols, assault rifles, knives, swords, craftboard cannons - all are tools used to wage war. Kinetic weapons are still, by and large, the arm de jure of the twenty-ninth century, and widely available to military forces and civilians alike. The vast energy requirements of energy weapons and their extreme size make them most useful as craftboard ordnance, where they do see some small-scale deployment.
# Weapons and weapon characteristics
Weapons have a number of statistics that determine their performance.

**Aim:** The Aim cost of a weapon represents the total time  (in AP) needed to accurately aim a firearm at a target. Typically, the smaller the weapon, the lower the Aim cost.

**Reload:** Reload cost measures the length of time it takes to replace a firearm’s empty magazine or battery with a new one. This increases with the complexity and weight of the firearm.

**Mêlée:** Mêlée cost is the amount of time needed to successfully strike an enemy with the firearm itself. This is typically most useful for intimidation or in extremely close quarters.

**Draw:** Draw cost is the time it takes to draw a weapon from its holster and prepare it for firing. Heavier and clumsier weapons have higher draw costs, while small and maneuverable ones have lower costs.

**Accuracy:** Weapon accuracy is measured in two values, separated by a slash: base accuracy and maximum accuracy. Base value is the accuracy of a weapon fired at the hip, or in a more casual firing position. Maximum accuracy is the accuracy of a deliberately aimed weapon. Powerful, long-range weapons like battle rifles and sniper rifles have high maximum accuracy, but low base accuracy, while submachine guns and pistols have a relatively high base accuracy, but are not made considerably more accurate when aimed with maximum accuracy.

**Rate of Fire (ROF):** Rate of fire indicates the cycling rate for a burst of automatic gunfire—that is, the maximum number of rounds expended during a single attack action. This is most important for determing the rate at which ammunition is expended by an automatic weapon. Some weapons, especially  those used in suppressive roles, have multiple firing rates.

**Damage:** Damage measures the amount of physical trauma that results from a hit by a weapon’s fire. Weapons with longer barrels tend to do greater damage due to increased bullet velocity, as do weapons that chamber larger cartridges.

**Spread:** As a weapon is fired continuously, without taking time to realign another shot, weapon recoil and spread becomes an issue. The size of the weapon’s cartridge is usually the largest contributor to the intensity of spread, though particularly small or large weapons also receive penalties and bonuses to spread.

**Range:** Range, given as three values—close, range increment and long-range—indicate the distances at which a weapon is able to be used effectively. Use of a weapon within close range and outside of long-range incurs penalties to Aim rolls. At every range increment above close-range, Aim rolls take consecutive -1 penalties.

**Capacity:** Capacity measures the default number of rounds a weapon is able to fire before having to be reloaded. Magazine size can be easily expanded via weapon upgrades or the use of extended magazines.

**Ammunition:** Ammunition indicates the cartridge chambered by the weapon. Changing the cartridge requires a barrel replacement and other complex modifications for most weapons.

**Weight:** Weight measures the weight of the firearm in question, contributing to a character’s carry weight as well as dictating the damage done with a mêlée attack (1d4 per kilogram, rounded up).

**Cost:** This measures the cost of the weapon for purchase, either new from the manufacturer, distributor or individual, or previously used, from a third-party. This varies widely depending on weapon manufacturer and any restrictions that may be placed on its sale.

# Weapon Categories
Each category of weapons has a distinct proficiency associated with it. Attempts to use a weapon with which a character is not proficient imparts a non-proficiency penalty.

## Pistol
Popular as personal defense weapons since their introduction in the 16th century CE, pistols are handguns with an integrated barrel and firing chamber. Almost always firing the smallest common cartridges, pistols are most effective against unarmored or lightly armored opponents, with their utility rapidly dropping off as targets are increasingly well-shielded. Trends toward small-profile, high-velocity rounds began during the twenty-first century and continued onward well into the future. Pistols have relatively low damage and accuracy, but benefit from a quick attack interval, fast draw time and speedy reloads.

**Real-life examples:** Colt M1911, Beretta 92FS.

## Submachine gun
Firing the same small-caliber round as a pistol, but in the frame of a scaled-down rifle or carbine, submachine guns are valuable for close-quarters combat, as well as situations requiring a maneuverable weapon. Their size and usability make them popular weapons among special forces and vehicle crews. Design trends toward high-velocity rounds used by pistols have been mirrored in submachine guns, making them capable of defeating light body armor. Firing pistol cartridges, the damage offered by submachine guns is unspectacular, but their handling characteristics are generally superior to larger, heavier-caliber firearms.

**Real-life examples:** H&K MP5, FN P90.

## Carbine
Originally designed for cavalry, carbines are lightened, shortened rifles, generally firing an intermediate cartridge. Sharing most of the ballistic performance of an assault rifle with the mobility and handling characteristics of a large submachine-gun, carbines are popular weapons in urban and close-quarters combat. The carbine’s prime weakness is its performance at range - both damage and accuracy decline at much shorter ranges than with assault or battle rifles.

**Real-life examples:** M4A1, AKS-74U.

## Assault rifle
Since their introduction in the last years of the Second World War, the assault rifle has since become the weapon de jure of modern combat. Firing an intermediate cartridge - smaller than the full-sized cartridges fired by battle rifles, but larger than pistol and submachine gun cartridges - assault rifles are powerful, accurate and generally effective out to fairly long ranges.

**Real-life examples:** AK-47, M16.

## Battle rifle
Though battle rifles lost much of their built-up goodwill during the middle of the twentieth century, they saw a renaissance during the Resource Wars, when increasingly heavy armor made a weapon capable of delivering high-performance and high-penetration shots a necessity on the battlefield. Despite their clumsier handling and the significantly increased recoil from the full-power cartridge, battle rifles remain lethal and accurate at ranges well-beyond carbines and assault rifles. Often assigned to marksmen as designated marksman rifles, battle rifles have again found their place in squad-based combat.

**Real-life examples:** FN FAL, M14.

## Shotgun
While the design has not seen dramatic improvements since the development of automatic variants in the late twentieth century, the shotgun rests comfortably as a niche in the military arsenal. Offering dramatic stopping power within its limited range, the shotgun remains popular in close-quarters combat - within trenches, in house-to-house fighting and due to its limited penetration of metal - in the close confines of craft.

**Real-life examples:** Mossberg 500, Benelli M4.

## Light machine gun
Man-portable weapons capable of firing a high volume of intermediate rounds downrange first came into popular usage in the beginning of the twentieth century with the Danish Madsen machine gun. Despite a pause in the introduction of newer designs for several decades after the Second World War, the 1970’s saw a resurgence in light machine gun development and adoption. Since then, it has become a valuable staple of modern military armament, especially in suppressive roles.

**Real-life examples:** M249, RPK

## Heavy weapons
Automatic weapons firing full-power rounds, or weapons firing rounds more powerful than those used in battle rifles generally fall into the category of “heavy weapons”. In the interest of a minimum of weapon proficiencies, sniper rifles, medium and heavy machine guns, grenade and missile launchers all fall into this category.

**Real-life examples:** Barrett M82 sniper rifle, M79 grenade launcher, M2 Browning machine gun

## Exie weapons
Other weapons are simply unfamiliar to humans. Either having unconventional layouts, feed mechanisms or too large or small for humans to comfortably use, exie weapons require a particular proficiency of their own. Exie weapons are sorted into individual proficiencies as well as under the general category of “exie weapons.”

## Mêlée weapons
