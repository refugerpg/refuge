**Imperium Arms Thensi (Exie):** The IA Thensi - “Conquerer” - is a relatively recent PDW developed by the Amasian gunsmiths at Imperium Arms. An exquisitely-designed submachine gun with a number of elaborately-integrated mechanisms to reduce recoil, the Thensi is a high-damage, easily-controllable weapon.
