**Ienet Defense Materials I42 Combat Rifle:** The design goals for the I40-series rifle were short - a one-hit kill, damn the consequences. Ienet Defense Materials’ I42 Combat Rifle is an improved version of the resulting weapon, firing the Vasquez Fabrication 8.5 x 56 mm full-power round. The heavy bullet and the weapon’s extreme muzzle velocity necessitated the use of a ten-round magazine with an incorporated battery. The Gauss firing mechanism helps balance what would otherwise be severe recoil, and the lack of moving parts contribute to the weapon’s exceptional reliability.
