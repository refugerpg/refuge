# Weapon modifications
Most weapons do not come adhered to its wielder’s exacting standards in performance and ergonomics. Luckily, the gunsmiths of the future are just as adept at modifying firearms as the ones of the present.

## Structural modifications
Structural modifications are non-exclusive (i.e., several can be applied at once) modifications to a weapon’s frame and construction materials.

**Folding stock:** A folding stock increases ergonomics and makes placement/displacement of a weapon considerably faster. Draw AP is reduced by 2, to a minimum of one.

**Polymer materials:** Replacing metallic components with advanced polymer substitutes reduces weight. Weight is reduced by 25%.

**Rebuilt magazine well:** A third-party magazine well makes reloading faster and more ergonomic. Reload AP is reduced by 2.

**Synthetic frame**: Reframing the weapon with polymers and synthetic-metallic alloys reduces weight and speeds up mêlée strikes. Mêlée speed is decreased by 2 AP.

## Mechanism modifications
Unlike structural modifications, only one mechanism modification can be applied at a time. These are rarely reversible, and require a decent investment to procure.

**Electronic stabilizer:** An custom electronic stabilizer for the weapon increases accuracy potential. Maximum accuracy is increased by 2.

**Operating rod upgrade:** A reconstruction of the weapon’s internal components decreases recoil, making the weapon more accurate with repeated shots. Spread is reduced by 2.

**Rebuilt firing chamber:** A rebuilt firing chamber increases muzzle velocity and damage. Damage is increased by one die step - d4 becomes d6, d6 becomes d8, etc.

**Barrel modifications:** Barrel mods, like mechanism modifications, are exclusive. They have relatively minor effects on a weapon’s performance, and are both cheap and as easy to replace as removing a barrel is.

**Reconstructed bolt:** A rebuilt firing mechanism increases fire rate. ROF is increased by 3.

**Barrel extension:** An extension to the barrel makes the weapon more accurate at range. Range is increased by 25%.

## External mounts
External mounts allow a weapon to house attachments. These can be attached to the barrel, as in the case of suppressors or flash hiders, housed below the barrel or attached to the top of the weapon.

**Barrel mount:** A threaded barrel allows the attachment of a silence or flash suppressor.

**Scope mount:** A rail mount atop the weapon allows for the attachment of scopes and sights. Some weapons come with integral rail mounts or sights.

**Underbarrel mount:** A rail mount under the weapon’s barrel allows for the attachment of grenade launchers, laser sighting modules and tactical lights, among other things.

# Weapon attachments
## Underbarrel attachments

**Bipod:** A bipod is a two-legged support for a firearm, attached to the underbarrel rail. When deployed on a stable surface—the weapon’s user receives a +3 bonus to maximum accuracy, a +3 bonus to base accuracy and a 2 point reduction in spread.

**Foregrip:** A foregrip is a small handle attached to the underbarrel rail of a weapon, allowing for better handling in close quarters. Base accuracy is increased by 2 and spread is decreased by 1.

**Grip-pod:** Grip-pod act as a foregrip with an internal bipod, that extends with the press of a button. Base accuracy is increased by 2 and spread reduced by 1 when the bipod is retracted. Max accuracy is increased by 2, base accuracy increased by 2 and spread reduced by 2 when the bipod is extended.
Extending and setting-up the bipod is a 4 AP action.

**Flashlight**: A flashlight allows the user to operate without the dim lighting penalty within close quarters.

**Bayonet:** An underbarrel bayonet greatly increases a weapon’s lethality in hand-to-hand combat. Mêlée damage is increased by 1d6.

**Laser aiming module:** A laser aiming module allows the user of a weapon to accurately light up targets at long range. Maximum accuracy is increased by 1.

**Electronic aiming module:** An electronic aiming module increases the weapon’s potential for quick target acquisition. Base accuracy is increased by 1.

## Barrel attachments

**Suppressor:** A suppressor reduces the sonic signature of a weapon. While not making it inaudible by any means, it can make the user’s location much more difficult to determine.

**Flash Hider:** A flash hider makes a weapon much more difficult to spot in low-light conditions.

**Compensator:** A compensator vents gas vertically from the front of the barrel, decreasing weapon spread with automatic fire. Spread reduced by 1.

## Non-magnifying sights

**Backup iron sights:** Backup iron sights allow a weapon fitted with a long-range scope to be used normally in CQB.

**Reflex sight:** Since their adoption for small arms in the second-half of the twentieth century, non-magnifying reflector (reflex) sights have been popular for speeding up target acquisition. Base accuracy is increased by 1.

**Red dot sight:** A specific type of reflex sight, red-dot sights provide a single illuminated point for targeting. Their precision greatly increases potential accuracy when compared to simple iron sights. Maximum accuracy is increased by 1.

**Holographic sight:** More complex (and expensive) than reflex sights, holographic diffraction sights incorporate a complex series of reflectors to produce a holographic reticule on a sight window. Base accuracy is increased by 2, maximum accuracy decreased by 1.

## Telescopic sights
**2x optical sight**: 2x optical sights, as their name suggests, imparts a 2x zoom on a sight, offering benefits when using the weapon at range. Its middling zoom means that while the weapon does not receive large bonuses to maximum accuracy, it doesn’t receive penalties to relatively close range, either. Maximum accuracy increased by 1.

**4x optical sight**: 4x optical sights impart a 4x zoom on target and offer a +2 bonus to maximum accuracy. The intensity of the zoom makes it relatively unsuitable for close-quarters combat and imparts a -1 penalty to base accuracy.

**8x optical sight:** Really only suitable for battle rifles and sniper rifles, 8x sights allow their users to accurately place fire at long ranges, but are actively unhelpful in CQB. Maximum accuracy is increased by 4, base accuracy reduced by 2.
