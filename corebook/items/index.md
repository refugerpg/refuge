Times change, and so does technology. Items - weapons, armor, tools, equipment, consumer electronics and transportation - dictate to a surprising extent the ways we live and the ways we die. The future is no exception. Any from a wide variety of items may appear in the midst of a campaign, and those from the twenty-ninth century would be as wildly unfamiliar to characters of the twenty-first as computers and the internet would be to a peasant living in the 13th century Europe. It is the hope of this chapter to offer a short overview of items  and equipment that may appear in campaigns taking place in the present to those taking place eight hundred years in the future.

For gameplay purposes, most equippable items are sorted into categories. To encourage specialization between characters of different classes, characters require proficiencies to use items from each of these categories to their fullest potential.
# Ammunition
A variety of ammunition exists, and it changes as quickly with the seasons as weapons, armor or technology. Here are several typically encountered variants on conventional ammunition for firearms and explosives.
## Full Metal Jacket
Standard ammunition for the vast majority of firearms, a full metal jacketed bullet consists of a soft metal projectile covered - “jacketed” - by a harder alloy. This permits use against both soft and hardened targets.
## Jacketed Hollow Point
Jacketed hollow point bullets have a distinctive dimple at the top of the round, permitting the round to expand upon delivery. This precludes the use of a full metal jacket and leaves the bullet vulnerable to interception by body armor, but is more lethal to unarmored targets.

*Effect*: +2 damage, -5 vs. Ballistic.
## Armor-Piercing
Some ammunition is specifically designed to serve against body armor or other protection. Armor-piercing ammunition consists of a hard metal bullet - often tungsten, hardened steel or tungsten carbide - surrounded by a copper or alloy jacket, which is destroyed upon impact. This allows the hardened projectile to further penetrate its target. AP ammunition is ironically less effective against unarmed targets because of its tendency to simply pass through with little opportunity to yaw and roll inside the target.

*Effect*: -2 damage, +5 vs. Ballistic.
## High Explosive
Other ammunition is designed to explode on impact. This ammuntion typically requires a larger case, and is such uncommon on any cartridge below full-size. In the case of grenades and explosives, high explosive is probably the most common type.

*Effect*: Damage is incurred as Shock.

## Incendiary
And other ammunition still is used to ignite flammable targets. Like high explosive rounds, incendiary rounds typically require at least a full-power cartridge. Incendiary grenades are more common.

*Effect*: Damage is incurred as Thermal.

## Shot
Perhaps the predominant form of ammunition for shotguns is self-evident. Shot refers to a collection of lead or other metal pellets that are typically fired from a shotgun. Shot is particularly effective against soft targets, with minimal penetration, making it ideal for close-quarters and indoor fighting.

## Slug
A solid projectile fired from a shotgun. Slugs are considerably more powerful against body armor than traditional shot, but are inherently limited in their design - an accurate shot must be placed: unlike with shot, slugs obviously do not disperse in air as they aproach their target.

*Effect*: Minimum Accuracy -2, Maximum Accuracy +2.

## Flechette
With more penetrating power than shot and slugs, flechettes are long sabots of metal, fired with the intent of shredding their target. Flechette ammunition is considerably more accurate at a distance than shot, but less accurate than slugs.

*Effect*: Minimum Accuracy -1, Maximum Accuracy +1.

## Fragmentation
Fragmentation grenades are designed to shatter upon detonation, spraying pieces of shrapnel within a small radius instead of inflicting damage through the shock wave alone.

*Effect*: Damage is incurred as Ballistic.

# Armor
For the last several hundred years of the first millenium, defensive technology was so wildly outclassed by weaponry that it was ignored entirely. Starting in the last years of the twentieth century, things changed. For the first time widely-available body armor was able to, if not stop a bullet outright, prevent it from causing life-threatening damage to someone hit by it. The race between weapons and armor, dormant since the introduction of man-portable firearms, was reignited with a fury and has not let up in the years since. This is the equipment that will save your life.
## Armor and Armor Characteristics
Armor has a number of statistics that determine its performance.
- Damage resistance: Armor is typically resistant to one or more types of damage - ballistic, chemical, energy, mêlée, shock and thermal.
- Attribute bonuses: Often, armor provides bonuses to user performance, often boosting durability, or in the more extreme cases of power armor, artificially enhancing the wearer’s strength and speed.
- Armor class: Armor is either light, medium, heavy or powered. Wearing armor without receiving the -5 nonproficiency penalty requires the appropriate ability for each type of armor.
- Max AP: Often, heavy armor slows a wearer down, making them unable to act as efficiently in the heat of combat. This armor imposes an artificial cap on a character’s action points per combat round.
- Max Dodge: Often, heavy armor imposes increasing difficulty on a wearer’s ability to move quickly and evade gunfire and other attacks. Most armors heavier than light armor have a maximum dodge score associated with them.
## Armor Categories
Each category of armor has a distinct proficiency associated with it. Attempts to use a piece of armor with which a character is not proficient imparts a nonproficiency penalty.
### Light Armor
Any armor that allows unrestricted or nearly unrestricted freedom of movement is classified as light armor. From padded jumpsuits to simple ballistic vests to more high-tech equipment, light armor typically does not offer the same level of ballistic or damage protection as medium, heavy or powered armor, but does not restrict the number of AP a character is able to spend in a round or the number of points a character can put toward a Dodge roll.
### Medium Armor
Medium armor - typically, full-body armor making heavy use of lightweight composites - has the advantage of conferring greater protection to damages of multiple types than light armor, but is heavier and generally restricts range and speed of motion to a mild degree.
### Heavy Armor
Stronger than medium and light armor, and often offering superior protection to powered armor, heavy armor will stop a bullet in its tracks. And much more. But it will also slow down the wearer considerably, restricting their ability to act swiftly as well as their ability to dodge gunfire.
### Powered Armor
Developed during the early years of the twenty-first century, powered armor was first commercialized for the mundane tasks of lifting and transporting particularly heavy items. Despite initial attempts to use powered exoskeletons to boost the strength and endurance of soldiers in combat, portable power supplies of the time were unable to sustain one for more than a few hours. It was not until the Resource Wars in the late twenty-first century that portable energy technology, and military necessity, intersected to justify the fielding of powered armor units. Ever since, they have been the armor of choice for the wealthy and those in need of the best protection money can buy. Powered armor generally boosts the capabilities of the wearer, but is bulky and restricts movement.
# Weapons
Pistols, assault rifles, knives, swords, craftboard cannons - all are tools used to wage war. Kinetic weapons are still, by and large, the arm de jure of the twenty-ninth century, and widely available to military forces and civilians alike. The vast energy requirements of energy weapons and their extreme size make them most useful as craftboard ordnance, where they do see some small-scale deployment.
## Weapons and Weapon Characteristics
Weapons have a number of statistics that determine their performance.

- Attack: All weapons have specific AP costs for attack. This number represents a combination of the time needed to chamber, sight and fire a single round, burst or short interval of automatic gunfire		Aim: The Aim cost of a weapon represents the total time  (in AP) needed to accurately aim a firearm at a target. Typically, the smaller the weapon, the lower the Aim cost.
-	Reload: Reload cost measures the length of time it takes to replace a firearm’s empty magazine or battery with a new one. This increases with the complexity and weight of the firearm.
-	Mêlée: Mêlée cost is the amount of time needed to successfully strike an enemy with the firearm itself. This is typically most useful for intimidation or in extremely close quarters.
-	Draw: Draw cost is the time it takes to draw a weapon from its holster and prepare it for firing. Heavier and clumsier weapons have higher draw costs, while small and maneuverable ones have lower costs.
-	Accuracy: Weapon accuracy is measured in two values, separated by a slash: base accuracy and maximum accuracy. Base value is the accuracy of a weapon fired at the hip, or in a more casual firing position. Maximum accuracy is the accuracy of a deliberately aimed weapon. Powerful, long-range weapons like battle rifles and sniper rifles have high maximum accuracy, but low base accuracy, while submachine guns and pistols have a relatively high base accuracy, but are not made considerably more accurate when aimed with maximum accuracy.
-	Rate of Fire (ROF): Rate of fire indicates the cycling rate for a burst of automatic gunfire—that is, the maximum number of rounds expended during a single attack action. This is most important for determing the rate at which ammunition is expended by an automatic weapon. Some weapons, especially  those used in suppressive roles, have multiple firing rates.
-	Damage: Damage measures the amount of physical trauma that results from a hit by a weapon’s fire. Weapons with longer barrels tend to do greater damage due to increased bullet velocity, as do weapons that chamber larger cartridges.
-	Spread: As a weapon is fired continuously, without taking time to realign another shot, weapon recoil and spread becomes an issue. The size of the weapon’s cartridge is usually the largest contributor to the intensity of spread, though particularly small or large weapons also receive penalties and bonuses to spread.
-	Range: Range, given as three values—close, range increment and long-range—indicate the distances at which a weapon is able to be used effectively. Use of a weapon within close range and outside of long-range incurs penalties to Aim rolls. At every range increment above close-range, Aim rolls take consecutive -1 penalties.
-	Capacity: Capacity measures the default number of rounds a weapon is able to fire before having to be reloaded. Magazine size can be easily expanded via weapon upgrades or the use of extended magazines.
-	Ammunition: Ammunition indicates the cartridge chambered by the weapon. Changing the cartridge requires a barrel replacement and other complex modifications for most weapons.
-	Weight: Weight measures the weight of the firearm in question, contributing to a character’s carry weight as well as dictating the damage done with a mêlée attack (1d4 per kilogram, rounded up).
-	Cost: This measures the cost of the weapon for purchase, either new from the manufacturer, distributor or individual, or previously used, from a third-party. This varies widely depending on weapon manufacturer and any restrictions that may be placed on its sale.

## Weapon Categories
Each category of weapons has a distinct proficiency associated with it. Attempts to use a weapon with which a character is not proficient imparts a nonproficiency penalty.
### Pistol
Popular as personal defense weapons since their introduction in the 16th century CE, pistols are handguns with an integrated barrel and firing chamber. Almost always firing the smallest common cartridges, pistols are most effective against unarmored or lightly armored opponents, with their utility rapidly dropping off as targets are increasingly well-shielded. Trends toward small-profile, high-velocity rounds began during the twenty-first century and continued onward well into the future. Pistols have relatively low damage and accuracy, but benefit from a quick attack interval, fast draw time and speedy reloads.
	Examples: Colt M1911, Beretta 92FS.
### Submachine gun
Firing the same small-caliber round as a pistol, but in the frame of a scaled-down rifle or carbine, submachine guns are valuable for close-quarters combat, as well as situations requiring a maneuverable weapon. Their size and usability make them popular weapons among special forces and vehicle crews. Design trends toward high-velocity rounds used by pistols have been mirrored in submachine guns, making them capable of defeating light body armor. Firing pistol cartridges, the damage offered by submachine guns is unspectacular, but their handling characteristics are generally superior to larger, heavier-caliber firearms.
	Examples: H&K MP5, FN P90.
### Carbine
Originally designed for cavalry, carbines are lightened, shortened rifles, generally firing an intermediate cartridge. Sharing most of the ballistic performance of an assault rifle with the mobility and handling characteristics of a large submachine-gun, carbines are popular weapons in urban and close-quarters combat. The carbine’s prime weakness is its performance at range - both damage and accuracy decline at much shorter ranges than with assault or battle rifles.
	Examples: M4A1, AKS-74U.
### Assault rifle
Since their introduction in the last years of the Second World War, the assault rifle has since become the weapon de jure of modern combat. Firing an intermediate cartridge - smaller than the full-sized cartridges fired by battle rifles, but larger than pistol and submachine gun cartridges - assault rifles are powerful, accurate and generally effective out to fairly long ranges.
	Examples: AK-47, M16.
### Battle rifle
Though battle rifles lost much of their built-up goodwill during the middle of the twentieth century, they saw a renaissance during the Resource Wars, when increasingly heavy armor made a weapon capable of delivering high-performance and high-penetration shots a necessity on the battlefield. Despite their clumsier handling and the significantly increased recoil from the full-power cartridge, battle rifles remain lethal and accurate at ranges well-beyond carbines and assault rifles. Often assigned to marksmen as designated marksman rifles, battle rifles have again found their place in squad-based combat.
	Examples: FN FAL, M14.
### Shotgun
While the design has not seen dramatic improvements since the development of automatic variants in the late twentieth century, the shotgun rests comfortably as a niche in the military arsenal. Offering dramatic stopping power within its limited range, the shotgun remains popular in close-quarters combat - within trenches, in house-to-house fighting and due to its limited penetration of metal - in the close confines of craft.
	Examples: Mossberg 500, Benelli M4.
### Light machine gun
Man-portable weapons capable of firing a high volume of intermediate rounds downrange first came into popular usage in the beginning of the twentieth century with the Danish Madsen machine gun. Despite a pause in the introduction of newer designs for several decades after the Second World War, the 1970’s saw a resurgence in light machine gun development and adoption. Since then, it has become a valuable staple of modern military armament, especially in suppressive roles.
	Examples: M249, H&K MG36
### Heavy weapons
Automatic weapons firing full-power rounds, or weapons firing rounds more powerful than those used in battle rifles generally fall into the category of “heavy weapons”. In the interest of a minimum of weapon proficiencies, sniper rifles, medium and heavy machine guns, grenade and missile launchers all fall into this category.
	Examples: Barrett M82 sniper rifle, M79 grenade launcher, M2 Browning machine gun
### Exie weapons
Other weapons are simply unfamiliar to humans. Either having unconventional layouts, feed mechanisms or too large or small for humans to comfortably use, exie weapons require a particular proficiency of their own. Exie weapons are sorted into individual proficiencies as well as under the general category of “exie weapons.”
### Mêlée weapons
