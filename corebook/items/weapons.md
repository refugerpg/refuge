# Pistols
A number of different pistols and models are available from weapons manufacturers. Most are capable of dropping an unarmored target within a single hit, and as such, are formidable and widely accessible personal defense weapons.

**Eberhard & Stafford ‘59 Special:** Widely considered to be among the best Gauss pistols ever created by the legendary weapons manufacturer, the Eberhard & Stafford ‘59 Special displays a nearly-perfect balance of damage, power consumption and reliability. The only obstacle that remains to most would-be buyers is the price. Even used specimens are expensive and difficult to obtain.

**Eberhard & Stafford ‘63 Custom:** While somewhat clumsier and less reliable than an E&S Gauss firearm, the E&S ‘63 Custom is capable of higher damage output, contains a larger magazine and does not suffer the overheating problems that can plague Eberhard & Stafford’s older premium models.

**IFS Fabrication M6:** The service pistol of most service members of the IFS Armed Forces, the M6 is a cheap automatic pistol. Firing in a two-round burst with a relatively unique mechanism that delays perceived recoil for the shooter, the M6 capable of dishing out considerable damage within a short time frame.

**Vasquez Fabrication Striker:** A devastating handgun capable of downing even a Tau within a mere handful of shots, the Vasquez Fabrication Striker is accurate, powerful and relatively ergonomic given its size. Its major downside is the price—commensurate with its power.

**Alliance Defender Defiler (Exie):** Firing a small intermediate round, the Defiler is a repeater handgun built by and for the Tau. Large-framed, large-bored and brutally efficient, the Defiler is the preferred sidearm for Tau warriors seeking a piece from home.

# Submachine Guns
**Imperium Arms Thensi:** The IA Thensi - “Conquerer” - is a relatively recent PDW developed by the Amasian gunsmiths at Imperium Arms. An exquisitely-designed submachine gun with a number of elaborately-integrated mechanisms to reduce recoil, the Thensi is a high-damage, easily-controllable weapon.

# Carbines
**Olea G24C:** A consumer-grade Olea Corporation Gauss carbine. Mass produced to lower costs, it is without question the cheapest production Gauss longarm available to the general public. As a civilian weapon, it fires at much lower velocities - and inflicts much less damage - than an equivalent military or match-grade weapon.

# Assault Rifles
**Eberhard & Stafford GR40**: The E&S GR40 is the current military export Gauss rifle model manufactured by Eberhard & Stafford. It uses a proprietary battery engineered to avoid the issues with overheating that have marred Gauss technology since its birth. The result is an exceptional, but expensive and heavy Gauss rifle able to fire for sustained periods of time.

# Battle Rifles
**Ienet Defense Materials I42 Combat Rifle:**
The design goals for the I40 series rifle were simple - a one-hit kill, damn the consequences. Ienet Defense Materials’ I42 Combat Rifle is an improved version of the resulting weapon, firing the Vasquez Fabrication 8.5 x 50 mm full-power round. The heavy bullet and the weapon’s extreme muzzle velocity necessitated the use of a powered, ten-round magazine. The Gauss firing mechanism helps balance what would otherwise be severe recoil, and the lack of moving parts contribute to the weapon’s exceptional reliability.
