For the last several hundred years of the first millennium, defensive technology was so wildly outclassed by weaponry that it was ignored entirely. Starting in the last years of the twentieth century, things changed. For the first time widely-available body armor was able to, if not stop a bullet outright, prevent it from causing life-threatening damage to someone hit by it. The race between weapons and armor, dormant since the introduction of man-portable firearms, was reignited with a fury and has not let up in the years since. This is the equipment that will save your life.
# Armor characteristics
Armor has a number of statistics that determine its performance.

**Damage resistance:** Armor is typically resistant to one or more types of damage - ballistic, chemical, energy, mêlée, shock and thermal.

**Attribute bonuses:** Often, armor provides bonuses to user performance, often boosting durability, or in the more extreme cases of power armor, artificially enhancing the wearer’s strength and speed.

**Armor class:** Armor is either light, medium, heavy or powered. Wearing armor without receiving the -5 non-proficiency penalty requires the appropriate ability for each type of armor.

**Max AP:** Often, heavy armor slows a wearer down, making them unable to act as efficiently in the heat of combat. This armor imposes an artificial cap on a character’s action points per combat round.

**Max Dodge:** Often, heavy armor imposes increasing difficulty on a wearer’s ability to move quickly and evade gunfire and other attacks. Most armors heavier than light armor have a maximum dodge score associated with them.

# Armor categories
Each category of armor has a distinct proficiency associated with it. Attempts to use a piece of armor with which a character is not proficient imparts a non-proficiency penalty.

**Light Armor:** Armor that allows unrestricted or nearly unrestricted freedom of movement is classified as light armor. From padded jumpsuits to simple ballistic vests to more high-tech equipment, light armor typically does not offer the same level of ballistic or damage protection as medium, heavy or powered armor, but does not restrict the number of AP a character is able to spend in a round or the number of points a character can put toward a Dodge roll.

**Medium Armor:** Medium armor - typically, full-body armor making heavy use of lightweight composites - has the advantage of conferring greater protection to damages of multiple types than light armor, but is heavier and generally restricts range and speed of motion to a mild degree.

**Heavy Armor:** Stronger than medium and light armor, and often offering superior protection to powered armor, heavy armor will stop most bullets in their tracks. But it will also slow down the wearer considerably, restricting their ability to act swiftly as well as their ability to dodge gunfire.

**Powered Armor:** Developed during the early years of the twenty-first century, powered armor was first commercialized for the mundane tasks of lifting and transporting particularly heavy items. Despite initial attempts to use powered exoskeletons to boost the strength and endurance of soldiers in combat, portable power supplies of the time were unable to sustain one for more than a few hours. It was not until the Resource Wars in the late twenty-first century that portable energy technology, and military necessity, intersected to justify the fielding of powered armor units. Ever since, they have been the armor of choice for the wealthy and those in need of the best protection money can buy. Powered armor generally boosts the capabilities of the wearer, but is bulky and restricts movement.
