## Money
The de facto currency in civilized space is the IFS credit. The credit is accepted on all but a few worlds—while most use their own local currencies, merchants and bankers are typically tolerant, if not entirely welcoming, of the IFS’s banknotes. Planets on the fringes are much more likely to have more primitive forms of currency, from literal coins to (in the most rural of areas) bartering systems.

## Trading & Transport
The transportation of rare trade goods to and from worlds can be a lucrative business, due in no small part to the substantial risk involved in faster-than-light travel. Moving trade goods from one planet to another in the same star system is less financially rewarding, but carries with it a much smaller chance of a potentially fatal accident.

The wide variety of economic and planetary conditions across inhabited space also has a substantial effect on the prices of imported and exported goods and materials. Planets with large amounts of natural resources export materials at a lower cost than planets with small amounts of natural resources. In the same vein, imports are well-compensated on planets with few natural resources of their own, while planets with an abundance of natural resources offer less for imported goods. Planets with need for a great deal of resources similarly offer more for imported ones, while the cost of already-scarce materials for export increases. Planets with few inhabitants require less resources, offering less for imported ones and more for exported materials.

Few crews with the financial resources, money can be made in buying, transporting and selling bulk goods. Some trade goods are of dubious legality and will have to be transported with care.

Other goods are required for the daily operation of the craft and survival of the crew.
