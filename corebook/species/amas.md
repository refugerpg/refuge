The Amas are the native inhabitants of Amas. Roughly 85% of the planet’s surface is water. As such, the Amas are excellent swimmers, but live exclusively in densely-populated cities on  the small island continents that dot the planet’s surace.
# Characteristics
**Personality:** The Amas are among the most enigmatic figures in known space. Their ethical and moral code is more or less inscrutable to outsiders, and is a source of frequent confusion and misinterpretation by other species. The actions of Amas can appear to be random or senseless to outsiders. Their tendency to hold grudges for centuries is notorious. Regardless, they adhere strongly to their own code of ethics, and for those who have earned their respect, the Amas prove to be singularly fierce allies.

**Physical description:** The Amas are thin and spindly, ranging anywhere from one-and-a-half to two meters in height. Befitting a species borne from a watery world like Amas, they have a distinctly aquatic appearance, with smooth - some would say clammy - skin, and vestigal gills spread across the sides of their upper necks. In color, they range from blue-grey to a dull green in color and have four-fingered, partially webbed hands. Amasians display minor sexual dimorphism - male Amasians have a prominent crest on their brows, and are slightly larger than female Amasians.

**Languages:** With voices described as somewhere between a rumble and a hiss, Amasians speak High Amas - the official diplomatic language of the Amas Imperium - Low Amas, a vulgar form of the more ‘elevated’ language, or a regional language. More isolated Amas may not speak either High or Low Amas.

They are unable to naturally speak any other languages but instead communicate with Humans and Meyek through the use of machine translators. Due to the continuing influence of the ore’enre, Amasians generally refuse to communicate with Solari, Amas or Tau except through third parties.

**Homeworld:** The vast majority of Amas are born, live and die on Amas, a planet of roughly five billion inhabitants. Some live in small concentrations on the nearby Telren and Keth. Others, mostly government and corporate figures, live in the Core. Even fewer have made a living traversing the stars.
# History
The Amas sprung from the sea in time immemorial, and colonized the large islands that stretch across Amas’s watery surface. While the Amas were mining the nearby planets of their solar system for rare minerals and metals by the beginning of the fifth century before the Massacre at Earth, they did not adopt AMD technology until the Contact Wars with the Tau.

The Avis had arrived on Tau some years earlier, and hoping to groom them as warriors, gave one of the planet’s more larger tribes access to weapons and AMD technology gleaned in turn from the Solari. Upon learning all they needed to know, the Tau executed their mentors and began to search for a new homeworld.
They invaded Amas in -428 MR, quickly laying waste to several Amasian cities and destroying a good deal of the planet’s industrial infrastructure. The planet fell under the control of the Tau in -425 MR, despite the best attempts of the Amas. Within a year a sizable Amasian resistance had risen and by -421 MR, had defeated the Tau occupiers.

A single tribe of Tau remained, who had declined to participate in the Contact War and had simply colonized a large, nearly-barren island considered uninhabitable by the Amas. This tribe - called by the Amas mes’enre  - remain on Amas to this day, and have frequently served as honorary Amas in military conflicts.

Within fifty years, the planet had again fallen to foreign oppressors. Still recovering from the devastation of the Contact Wars, Amas was taken by the forces of the expanding First Solari Empire in -362 MR. Though they were again able to destroy the occupying force, the repeated subjugation suffered by the Amas was a transformational one.  

Even moreso than in the past, the Amas grew insular and hostile to outsiders. They adopted the ore’enre, the doctrine of isolationism and summary execution against the Tau – who had first subjugated their planet, weakening it against later foreign powers – the Avis – enablers of the Tau – and the Solari – who attempted to dominate their homeworld in their quest for an enlightened, unified interstellar government.

Their self-imposed isolation did not serve in their favor when humanity arrived in known space. The planet was set upon by a human-Solari coalition, which quickly secured a surrender from the ill-prepared Amas.

The Tau returned to Amas in 46 MR in an attempt to secure their assistance against the Amas. Tau and Amasian emissaries, mediated by the mes’enre, were unable to come to a mutually agreeable decision, and the Tau attempted to strong-arm the Amas. It backfired when the IFS arrived; combined, the Amas and IFS beat the Tau back.

The Tau did not make diplomatic overtures to the Amas for another 150 years. As IFS control began to slowly slide toward subjugation, the Amas broke ore’enre to join forces with the Tau, Avis and Meyek in the Second Terran War.

In 227 MR the war was over - destruction was visited upon Avis by twelve Advent Horizon-class cruisers the year before. The Amasian military hierarchy was killed in the attack, rendering the Amas - and Tau and Meyek, to say nothing of the Avis, who were almost wiped from the face of known space in the attack - incapable of continuing the fight. The Amas begrudgingly accepted IFS authority in the years afterward.

# Politics
**Representative body:** The Amas are represented in the IFS by the Amas Imperium, founded after the end of the Second Terran War. The Imperium is a hegemonic empire controlled by the thensi oligarchy, composed of Amasian military commanders and political leaders. Most of the empire’s states are offered limited self-determination, but are ultimately bound to the will of the thensi.

**Political relationships: IFS:** Despite being aligned against the IFS during the First Terran War and a key force against the Federation during the Second Terran War, the Amas have since begrudgingly accepted IFS control and are ostensibly aligned with the Federation. Several battalions of Amasian soldiers and several dozen Amasian frigates and cruisers ostensibly serve on behalf of the IFS military, though they frequently reject seemingly benign orders from IFS brass. The IFS military only relies on the Amas when their orders involve killing Tau, Solari or Humans.

**Interspecies relationships: Tau:** The Amas and the Tau have long been enemies. The Contact Wars between the two species long before the arrival of humans or even Solari into known space has more or less permanently poisoned the relationships between the two species. That being said, the Amas and the Tau have been known to join forces in defense against their common enemy - humanity.

**Interspecies relationships: Mes’enre:** The mes’enre are a unique case. Descendants of the Tau warriors who opted to colonize a barren, nearly uninhabitable island on Amas instead of conquering Amasian cities, the mes’enre have historically served as ambassadors with the Tau, and as legionnaires serving on behalf of the Amas. Despite having officially repudiated the Tau centuries before, the Amas value the role of the mes’enre in their political dealings with them.

**Interspecies relationships: Solari and Avis:**  The First Solari Empire briefly occupied Amas in the years before the Massacre, and accompanied the Terran attack fleet that took the planet in the First Terran War. The Amas have since held an unspoken doctrine to destroy all Solari and Avis craft on sight; the Amas Imperium refuses to hold diplomatic negotiations in the presence of either the Solari or Avis. The centuries-long IFS occupation of the Solari’s homeworld is speculated to be among the reasons for their warming relationship with the IFS.

**Interspecies relationships: Meyek:** Perhaps due to the infamous Meyek Massacre that started the Second Terran War, the Amas have typically held warm relations with the Meyek, and have been some of their strongest advocates in recent years.

# Amas in Gameplay
**Attribute scores:** Amas receive a +1 bonus to Dexterity and Agility, and a -1 penalty to Constitution and Charisma.

**Bonus Abilities:** Amasians recevive the Weapons Proficiency: Exie Weapons ability upon character creation.

**Bonus Traits:** Amasians receive the Amas Trait upon character creation.

**Amasians as PCs:** The Amas rarely join forces with non-Amasian unless guided by a very strong cause. Only retribution against a mutal enemy or some other moral cause is enough to cement a bond of fellowship between an Amasian and a non-Amasian. The occasional, more idealistic Amasian will join forces with a Solari, Avis or Tau, but they are few and far in-between.

**Amasians as NPCs:** Amasians are rarely found outside of their home and neighboring systems, but are occasionally encountered as mercenaries, bounty hunters and theosi, professional killers who continue grudges on behalf of employers.

**Common classes:** Amasians make particularly gifted Scouts and Soldiers. Despite being physically fragile and often unpleasant to encounter, they are skilled commandos and ambushers, often capable of finishing fights moments after they start.
