A character’s species is no more a cosmetic choice than the choice of class or faction is. While the relationships between individuals of each species and the species themselves are complex and constantly shifting, the weight of the past constantly bears on them. Old vendettas, failed negotiations, or simple bad blood between two species may dictate the course of an interaction even more than its characters’ own abilities and personalities.

Due to their inherent abilities and tendencies, some species are more closely oriented with specific classes than others are. Nearly all Tau make excellent Supports and Soldiers, but a Tau Ambassador might find himself fighting an uphill battle against his own nature. That isn’t to say that species should be a primary criterion for choosing a character class, but it should be something taken into consideration.

All of the species in Refuge are described here with most pertinent information and their relationships with others in known space. The personalities, physical descriptions and languages are covered in each species’ Characeristics section. History contains a relatively brief description of the last five centuries or so years of each species’ histories - its wars, societal and cultural developments and diplomatic dramas, setting the stage for their relationships with other factions and species described in Politics. Finally, the In Gameplay section describes the roles each species may play in the course of a campaign, as well as specific statistic bonuses, penalties and unique modifiers members of each species have.

These include modifiers to attribute scores - each species, apart from humans, are more or less inclined to some physical and intellectual characteristics than others - a Tau of average strength is considerably stronger than a human of average strength; in the same vein, an unintelligent Solari may be considerably smarter than an Avis of average intelligence. Players choosing races that have dramatically altered attribute scores - notably the Solari, but to a lesser extent the Tau - should take care not to handicap a character by way of species selection, simply because playing a handicapped character can end up being an unpleasant affair.

Each of these six species - the Amas, Avis, Humans, Meyek, Solari and Tau - are all different, sharing few common ideals between them, and often more at odds with one another than in agreement. But at the same time, none of them are so wildly alien as to be entirely unintelligible to a sufficiently informed role-player. And despite each species having tendencies commonly described by the others as ‘random’ or ‘senseless,’ it’s important for players to sufficiently understand the motivations of each species so that decisions aren’t actually random or senseless.

So read up, but understand at the same time that individuals of other species aren’t any more slaves to their cultural histories and tendencies any more than we are to ours. There have always been and will always be outliers.
