While the Solari may have been the first to encounter humanity, the Massacre on Earth made the Tau the first to make an impression. Evolved to survive on a hellish planet with nightmarish geography and a nearly toxic atmosphere, the Tau are incredibly hardy and intimidating creatures.

Locked in a constant struggle against the environment and one another has left the Tau with something of a violent streak. Their bleached-white armor is traditionally fashioned from the bones of opponents in the battle royale-cum-coming-of-age ritual that marks the transition for a juvenile Tau into full maturity.
# Characteristics
**Personality:** Due to the incredibly harsh conditions of their homeworld, Tau are particularly combative—for resources, as well as anything else they want or need—and are rarely inclined to solve a conflict without violence.

**Physical description:** The average Tau is nearly two and a half meters in height and weighs in excess of 150 kilograms. Their skin—nearly always concealed beneath their armor—is dark, leathery and incredibly tough. A distributed nervous and circulatory system makes them extremely resiliant to physical trauma.

**Languages:** There exist a number of regional dialects of Tau, mostly associated with tribal groups. The dialect known as Common Tau, though rarely spoken as a first language, is a relatively prominent auxiliary one, and is the official dialect of Tau used for most interspecies diplomacy work.

**Homeworld:** Before the Second Terran War, few lived away from their homeworld of Tau. The years afterward have seen them disperse throughout the galaxy, often serving as enforcers, mercenaries or bounty hunters.
# History

The Tau were had their first encounter with another species in the sixth century before the Massacre on Earth. The ever-transient Avis arrived on the planet and quickly saw the potential for destruction in the then-primitive, largely tribal Tau.

To say that the Avis underestimated the capabilities of the Tau is an understatement. Their technological progress was mostly limited by the brutal circumstances of their homeworld - not by their intelligence. Soon after acquiring the technology from the Avis, the Tau killed them and began their quest to find a more hospitable homeworld.

The arrival of Avis scouts on Amas some years earlier offered them a first target. A Tau strike force arrived on Amas in -428 MR, meeting heavy resistance. Through brute force and sheer willpower, the Tau managed to subjugate the planet in -425 MR. Their attempts to colonize the world were unsuccessful. Within four years the Amas had summoned a sizable resistance to the Tau, and the ongoing struggle for the planet grew simply unsustainable for the would-be conquerers. Though nearly all Tau military forces had left the planet by -421, several tribes of Tau remained on the planet, living on islands considered uninhabitable by the Amas, but fairly comfortable by Tau standards. Over time, the so-called Lost Tribe managed to integrate with the Amas, and their descendants proved crucial to organizing the Second Insurrection.

Having been unsuccessful in their attempts to expand to Amas, the Tau, now organized as the Tau Confederacy and afforded recognition  by the First Solari Empire after a long string of inconclusive battles, eventually began to spread to nearby Telren. Aile’s frigid climate proved unsuitable for even the Tau; it was not for almost four hundred years that the Tau attempted to colonize the world.

This colonization saw the Tau encounter humanity for the first time, twelve years before the Massacre on Earth. The presence of new creatures in known space proved an irresistable target for the Tau, who systematically hunted down and destroyed each of the human colonies on the planet. Information gleaned from their quickly-translated archives identified the location of Earth.

The Tau arrived on July 6th, 2337. Having learned from their unsuccessful attempt to subjugate the inhabitants of a potential colony world, they instead opted to eliminate the population entirely. The Tau carpet-bombed millions of square miles of the planet surface with nuclear weapons. The carnage was unfathomable - nearly all of the planet’s population was killed, and the Tau left, waiting for the nuclear fallout to clear before returning.

The Tau failed to notice or destroy the thousands of mining vessels in orbit around the gas giants in the outer solar system; this ultimately proved their undoing. An evacuation of the survivors commenced rapidly, and the humans quickly began to inhabit Icre.

The First Terran War began twenty years later with a human victory over Meyek. A year later the humans arrived at Tau and bombarded the planet from orbit. The sheer destruction rendered them incapable of halting the human advance, leaving them to stand by helplessly as system after system fell to the Terran Federation. The Intergalactic Federation of Systems was formed, and the Tau were subjugated for the first time.

They recovered quickly, and lashed out against the fledgling IFS in 46 MR, taking and executing hostages on Aile after a failed IFS rescue attempt. The Tau began to lash out at nearby systems, launching an ill-advised offensive at Amas in an attempt to brow-beat them into cooperating with them against the IFS. It was unsuccessful, and the Tau were beaten back to their homeworld by the end of 46.

A long and bloody battle commenced. Numerous ground-to-space weapons had been installed since the last attack; the IFS were forced to go to ground on the hostile planet. Climate and volcanic activity were at an all-time high during the attack, and the IFS suffered vast casualties as they slowly destroyed enough ground emplacements to ensure a successful orbital assault. The Tau surrendered hours after the first barrages began.

With two catastrophic losses in a matter of decades, the Tau were forced to submit to IFS authority and control. It would not be for another hundred-and-fifty years that they would be again able to launch a military offensive against the IFS.

The time came in 217 MR. A series of violent revolutions on Icre and Avis saw the IFS forces there routed. The Interim Republics of Icre and Avis (IRIA) were formed, and the Tau quickly joined talks with them and left the IFS.

The IFS quickly moved to threaten Tau again with an invasion force, but were rebuffed by the combined forces of the Tau and IRIA. The IFS suffered a catastrophic defeat, and a number of other exie systems quickly seceeded, forming the Second Insurrection.

The war continued for nearly a decade, and a temporary stalemate surfaced in 225. There was some speculation that an armistice would be reached, allowing the SI planets to move on outside of IFS control.

The Second Terran War ended in 227, but not with an armistice. Twelve Advent Horizon-class cruisers arrived at Avis in the midst of an  SI conference. How the planetary defense systems were deactivated for a short window remains classified, but within moments, the planet’s surface was consumed in nuclear fire. The SI command hierarchy was  eviscerated, and it dissolved in a matter of weeks. The IFS’s control over the galaxy was solidified; the Second Terran War was over.
In the 250 years since, the Tau have not attempted another insurrection. Instead they have grown to integrate with other IFS worlds. Many Tau have since moved off-world to serve as bounty hunters, mercenaries, and hired muscle. Many older Tau still preach resistance to IFS control, but many of the younger generations have grown to accept its dominion for the foreseeable future.

# Politics
**Representative body:** The Tau are represented by the Tau Alliance, formed in the aftermath of the Second Terran War.

**Political relationships: IFS:** The Tau are largely unwilling participants in the Federation. The series of humiliating defeats they have suffered at the IFS’s hands has left many Tau resentful of the Federation, though most are willing to work within its confines and are more or less tolerant of humans they view to be competent. Several batallions of Tau shock troopers serve in the IFS Military, though they are segregated from all but the most experienced human troopers.

**Interspecies relationships: Amas:** The Tau are much less antagonistic toward the Amas than the Amas are to the Tau. The Tau view them as worthy combatants, especially after the Second Terran War. Most are bemused by the ongoing grudge for the temporary occupation of Amas during the Contact Wars.

**Interspecies relationships: Solari and Avis:** The Solari and the Tau have historically excellent terms with the Solari, as far as interspecies relationships with the Tau go. Since before the Massacre, they have shared a mutual understanding and respect. The Tau are on somewhat poorer terms with the Avis, though by no means violent. Despite having murdered the Avis who bestowed upon them technology, they are appreciative.

**Interspecies relationships: Terran:** The Tau have a complicated relationship with humanity. They are well aware that their failed extermination of the human race laid the groundwork for their own subjugation at the hands of the IFS. On the other hand, they are much more willing than the Amas to acknowledge their worthy opposition in humanity. Individual Tau may get along well with individual humans, especially within paramilitary or mercenary circles, but the vast majority of civilian Tau and humans keep the other at arm’s length.

**Tribes:**  Roughly analogous to nation-states, Tau on their homeworld are organized into tribes - nomadic groups with a common racial background. Tau from different tribes generally speak different languages, have different appearances and distinctive armor patterns.

# Tau in Gameplay
**Attribute Scores:** What the Tau lack in good manners, they make up for in strength and durability. Tau receive a +2 bonus to their Constitution score, and take a -2 penalty to Charisma.

**Bonus Traits:** Tau receive the Tau Trait upon character creation.

**Tau as PCs:** Due to their violent tendencies and incredible strength, many Tau serve in paramilitary and mercenary organizations, as well as bounty hunters and muscle. Despite their portrayal in IFS propaganda, the Tau are not wild brutes. They are calculating creatures, and no less intelligent than humans or the other species in known space. They’re more than willing to work for money, and have little use for the moral crusades of others.

**Tau as NPCs:** Many Tau remain on their homeworld or Telren, but are relatively common in the rest of known space, especially compared to their longtime rivals, the Amas. The further out of civilized space one finds oneself, the more likely one is to encounter a Tau - they’re drawn to all manner of unsavory work.

**Common classes:** Tau make ideal Soldiers, Supports and Spacers. They are tough and hardy, and extremely competent in armed (and unarmed) combat.
