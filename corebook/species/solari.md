The Solari are a dying race.

Fifteen generations of genetic experimentation with the intent of creating a perfected, post-Avis race has left them creatures of staggering intellect and perception, and among the most skilled writers, artists and ambassadors ever seen in known space.

They’re also sterile - almost universally so. The same genetic experimentation that created the race able to develop the AMD proved to be their own downfall. So the Solari attempt to stave off the inevitable through cloning, but their inability to perfect the technology and IFS restrictions on the practice and its research has resulted in fewer and fewer genetically ‘perfect’ Solari.

Within a few centuries, the Solari will be extinct. None are as conscious of this inevitability as the Solari are themselves.

# Characteristics
## Personality
As much as any species has a sole defining trait, the Solari are idealists. Their ideal of interspecies unification is most important to their culture. They’ve learned the hard way that most species are not keen to being subject states to the Solari. Humanity’s arrival in the first century MR and plans for an interstellar federation offered a moment of renewed hope for their cause, and they willingly joined the Terran Federation of Systems in the First Terran War. A series of betrayals and failures, along with their keen awareness of their own decline, as left them very cautious participants in interstellar politicking ever since. This caution, along with centuries of experience and their formidable intelligence, has made them particularly skilled operators of AMD technology.
## Physical description
Solari are typically described by humans as  “birdlike.” With a pointed, beaked skull and decorative feather-like plumage, the description is an apt one. A series of minor, but compounding misjudgments in their genetic augmentation has lef them mostly sterile.
## Languages
Nearly all Solari are multilingual. The Solari speak Solari, a language constructed in the aftermath of their transformation, and Avis.
# History
## Homeworld
The Solari originated on the planet bearing their name, but hold small colonies on Olea and Keth, founded in the glory years of the First Solari Empire.
## History
Judging from the tendencies of both species, the common ancestors to the Solari and Avis - typically referred to by both species as  ‘precursors,’ though likely genetically identical to the present-day Avis - were a reserved, technologically-inclined race. Though they had perfected the design of the AMD, the secret to interstellar travel, nearly a thousand years before the Massacre on Earth, the precursor race never sought to expand from its home in the Solari system, to colonize new worlds.

The precursors were instead locked in a debate over the future of their race. With the potential for an idealized genetic ‘perfection’ on the horizon, some precursors advocated for wide-scale genetic engineering and manipulation, seeking to wield the guiding hand of evolution themselves in the interest of creating a superior species.

This view was not a universally popular one. Religious and philosophical objections on top of scientific concerns led a number of precursors to simply leave. They began to spread out across the stars, seeking to uplift more primitive species with the technology they had developed, and leaving the genetic manipulation firmly on their homeworld.

Others continued forward - within three hundred years, the precursors had managed to augment their species’ already formidable intelligence. Within another two hundred, they had increased their sensory capabilities well-beyond those of their ancestors. Five hundred years before the Massacre on Earth, they emerged as the Solari. Their newfound purpose: to unite the races of known space under the banner of the First Solari Empire.

They first colonized Keth, Olea, and quickly spread to other nearby systems - to Alcesar, to Eza. Many of these worlds were home to Avis colonists who had settled the worlds centuries earlier.

Bloody conflicts ensued, the likes of which the Solari should have, but clearly did not anticipate. The Solari, despite having superior tactical and technological prowess compared to their cousins, sustained considerable losses in their attempt to unify Avis and Solari space.

The Avis were unwilling to cooperate with a species who they saw as abominations of science, despite whatever intentions they might have had. With a more rapid reproductive cycle and sheer force of will the Avis exacted painful losses from the Solari, who, despite having the capability, were horrified at the prospect of exterminating them entirely.

Invasions of Amas and Tau space also went poorly - both were as unwilling as the Avis to cede control of their systems to a foreign power. Solari forces managed to take Amas in -362 MR, but left as it became clear that the Amas were violently disinterested in their leadership. The forces of the First Solari Empire fought to a standstill with the Tau Confederacy. The Tau continue to admire, to this day, the military and tactical prowess of the Solari, if not their unwillingness to  commit atrocities in the name of their cause.

Solari scouts reached Earth in -381 MR, but were shot down the by the US Military over Roswell, New Mexico and did not return their homeworld. The loud arrival of humanity in known space some four hundred years later, and their ostensible desire to create a single, united government of all species proved attractive to the Solari, and they sent envoys to the fledgling Terran Federation of Systems to discuss their plans. The Solari hoped to use the Terran ferocity and expansionary tendencies to their advantage, and the Terran hoped to use the formidable Solari military and technological resources to theirs.

Neither the Solari nor the Terran were being honest with the other in the subsequent negotiations. Both knew it. Though their designs for a interstellar federation appeared congruent, they were built with two radically different outcomes in mind. The ends for humanity were survival - the means were any interstellar power capable of holding the exies in line. They declined to inform the Solari that their desire for the creation of an interstellar community of equals was not part of that plan.

The Solari intended to use humanity to do their dirty work; to comitt the atrocities they would not, and to field the batallions of soliders in combat they never could, all to emerge from behind the scenes as the dust settled and wrest control of the Terran Federation of Systems from humanity as the benevolent saviors and unifiers of known space - all the while professing their cooperation in the war was coerced.

The Solari joined the TFS in 22 MR with condition that no nuclear weapons were to be used on civilians in the future campaign. The Solari knew all too well that any perceived Solari cooperation in a nuclear strike on non-military targets would ruin their chances to unite the exie races, and accompanied the Terran in their rout above Amas. The Amas were particularly displeased at the arrival of the Solari in their third foreign occupation in five hundred years, and refused to accept the Solari insistence in private negotations at the armistace treaty that the Solari were being coerced into fighting on the side of the TFS.
With the Amas suitably pacified, the Terran Federation of Systems departed for Tau via Telren. Within minutes of arriving at Tau, the Solari forces knew something was wrong. Only half of the Terran fleet was present, and within seconds they had begun to launch salvos of space-to-surface nuclear missiles indiscriminately toward the planet surface.

The Solari had been betrayed. The rest of the Terran fleet had left for Solari instead of Tau after reaching Telren, and quickly destroyed the Solari craft in orbit around their homeworld. The Terran at Tau had little interest in fighting a conventional battle against the Tau, instead opting to blanket as much of the Tau’s in nuclear hellfire as the Tau had theirs.

The Solari were aghast, and quickly returned to Solari to confront the Terran command, only to be ambushed by TFS craft and routed. The survivors returned to a conquered planet, with menacingly-oriented TFS tactical missiles in orbit and an armistice to sign.

With the surrender of the Solari, the Intergalactic Federation of Systems was formed in 23 MR, including in its members the Meyek, Avis, Solari, Tau and Amas.

For the first time, though under the threat of nuclear devastation, all the species of known space were united under one banner.

So for the last four-and-a-half centuries the IFS has occupied Solari Theta, the number of human immigrants to the planet soon outnumbering the Solari themselves.

# Politics
## Representative body
The Solari Collective represents the Solari on the IFS Council, and serves as the IFS representative of Solari in the IFS Assembly. The White Talon has operated as a resistance movement since before the Second Terran War.
## Interspecies relationships: Tau
The Tau and the Solari are on relatively good terms, despite having fought several bloody wars against one another in the fourth century before the Massacre. Despite their differences, both species admire the others’ resilience. Individual Solari and Tau have been known to form business partnerships together, Solari offering the brains and the Tau the brawn.
## Interspecies relationships: Human
The Solari are not on nearly as good of terms with humanity. The four-century occupation of their homeworld by the IFS and the IFS’s ban on transspecies experimentation, the likes of which that could reverse the Solari’s sterility, are both particularly sore points. Still, the IFS the closest thing in known space to the Solari’s hope for an interstellar community of equals, and the Solari still seek to improve it from within.
## Interspecies relationships: Avis
The Solari have a complicated relationship with the Avis, to put it lightly. The Avis view the Solari as abominations and an offense to their religious convictions. The Solari are protective of the Avis on the interstellar political stage, and hope that someday the attempt at stewardship will help the two species come to an agreement and live in peace.
## Interspecies relationships: Amas
The Solari have invaded Amas not once but twice, and have incurred a disproportionate amount of the Amas’ wrath. As such, the ore’enre is still in effect after some seven hundred years, and has no signs of letting up soon. The Amas refuse to negotiate in the presence of the Solari, to the consternation of the IFS.
# Solari in Gameplay
## Attribute scores
The Solari are physically quite frail, receiving a -2 penalty to their Constitution score. They are, however, keenly intelligent and have a strong sense of spatial awareness and receive a +1 bonus to Intelligence and Perception.
## Bonus Traits
Solari receive the Solari Trait upon character creation.
## Solari as PCs
Most Solari are reserved and, given their species’ perilous future, understandably reluctant to engage in particularly dangerous adventuring. Other, more nihilistic Solari welcome the violence and uncertainty of life in outer reaches of known space with open arms.
## Solari as NPCs
While most Solari remain on Solari Theta, they are not entirely uncommon as traders or spacers, due to their considerable navigation skills and facility with AMD technology.
