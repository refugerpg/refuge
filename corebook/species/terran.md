Most prominent in the Refuge RPG, both in political and sheer volume, are humans, known to many exies as Terran. After fleeing a devastated Earth in the 24th century CE, humanity had nothing left to lose. Lashing out against their newfound alien neighbors, the Terran Federation of Systems laid seige to known space, establishing human control over most exie worlds and laying waste to those who resisted in  the First Terran War. Despite numerous exie attempts to dislodge human authority, humanity has maintained a death-grip over most of known space ever since.

# Characteristics
**Personality:** Humans have a notorious expansionary streak. Ever since the devastation of Earth, humanity has been left without a homeworld of its own, and have sought to colonize every one they can reach as a result.

**Physical description:** Humans are fairly average in size, similar to the Amas, but with both lower and higher extremes in size. Their skin color varies widely, from pale beige to dark brown. They display slight sexual dimorphism, with men on average taller and heavier than women. Humans are relatively short-lived; without expensive medical care, they rarely see past their first century.

**Languages:** Most humans speak Late English, either natively or as a second language though many inhabitants of Alcesar speak a variant of modern French. Other languages originating on Earth have been preserved in smaller numbers.

**Homeworld:** Humanity originated on Earth, abandoned the planet over the course of the Exodus from Earth in the years after the Massacre, and have (at one time or another) populated nearly every other inhabited planet in known space. This tendency has not won them any friends in interstellar politics.

# History
The twenty-first century was a dark time for humanity. Its first fifty years saw widespread drought and famine across the world, hitting the developing world especially hard. Many African and Asian nations, with burgeoning populations, were incapable of providing for their people, with water shortages an increasing problem - both issues the Wesetern world, with its relatively developed industrial and agricultural technology, did not have. Nor did the West elect to contribute to their cause. This suffering bred resentment, and eventually erupted in the catastrophic Resouce Wars between the United Nations Command and Asiatic-African Federation in 2093.

The conflict lasted for nearly half a century, and ended in a Pyrrhic victory on the side of the UNC. Civilian casualties were enormous, reducing the environmental stresses caused by a population that had been rapidly approaching ten billion. Reconstruction was slow and laborious, but within a century, Earth had began to explore the outer reaches of the solar system, heavily mining the asteroid belt for precious metals and extending further to the gas giants, and by the beginning of the 24th century, thousands of these large mining craft were spread across the solar system. This proved to be the salvation of the one species and the damnation of the rest.

On July 6th, 2337 CE, the Tau arrived with two dozen orbital bombardment platforms and began a saturation-bombing campaign across the planet’s surface, targeting the planet’s most densely-populated urban centers with high-yield thermonuclear warheads. Billions were killed within the first hours of the attack, nearly all of its cities obliterated. The Tau left, waiting for the radioactive fallout to clear before returning. One of the Tau OBPs were downed over the Midwestern United States.

The sudden silence from earth spurred a return from the mining fleets, who were quickly made contact with remnants of their home governments.

Within a year, what remained of the United Nations had gathered the wealth of resources from the downed Tau OBP, and successfully constructed a working prototype AMD. A small mining freighter was fitted with the prototype and christened the First Exodus. The First Exodus left for Aile, the last known destination of Terran colonists who had fled Earth during the Resource Wars.

After narrowly surviving a Tau attack, the First Exodus returned with news of the location of Icre, a large verdant world that was reachable within a matter of months with the Tau AMD.

As orbital workers tirelessly converted the old mining vessels into something capable of ferrying the remains of the human race to known space, the military mind of Earth began to lay plans for the long-term security of their species and a strike against the Tau, one that would not bear fruit for another thirty years.

The exodus to Icre was successful; though several of the mining craft were lost in transit, overall the Tau AMD proved a reliable method of transit.

Humanity went dark, only to surface again in 21 MR with a fleet of converted mining vessels covered in heavy armor and bristling with cannons and missiles. They traveled across the system to engage the Avis, who they found all too willing to join them in their revenge against the Tau. The Avis joined humanity. With the professed desire to corral a military force strong enough to engage them, the Avis joined humanity in a series of hit-and-run attacks on Meyek. The planet subdued and offering to commit military resources to their cause, the three species formed the Terran Federation of Systems.

They soon were met by Solari envoys; the powerful alien species hoped to leverage humanity’s expansionary tendencies in their pursuit of a united interstellar community. Of course, both the Solari and the Terran were being duplicitous.

The Solari joined the Terran Federation in its subjugation of Amas, the Avis and Solari fighting side-by-side for the first time, and quickly moved onward to confront the Tau. But the Solari were deceived. Half of the Terran fleet had returned to Solari after leaving Telren en route to Tau, destroyed the Solari craft in orbit above the planet and began orbital strikes on  Solari military and factory sectors.

Meanwhile at Tau, the Terran fired hundreds of nuclear missiles at the surface Tau. The Solari were horrified and fled back to Solari, only to be engaged and routed by the Terran forces there.

With known space loosely secured under the threat of nuclear bombardment, the Terran quickly began to expand and lock-down their acquisitions. With no home-planet to lose, the Terran were at a distinctly advantageous position in politicking. It would require a concerted, timed effort from a number of exie species across a number of planets to extinguish the human race now, whereas most exies were concentrated at their homeworlds, and vulnerable to threat of planetary extinction.

So humanity spread, united with the exies under the banner of the Intergalactic Federation of Systems. The Tau and the Amas attempted to recover from the devastation of the war, and the Solari realized that their species could not afford an all-out war on the planet’s surface. The IFS’s relationship with the Meyek and Avis was far more cordial, and offered the IFS its only allies.

The Tau began demanding reparations from the IFS in 27 MR, a claim that was repeatedly dismissed by by the IFS Assembly. A hostage crisis on Aile that ended in the vicious execution of hundreds of humans saw the IFS engage in its first military campaign. A Tau surprise attack that interrupted a diplomatic meeting with the Amas was foiled by a small IFS fleet, and the Amas decided to join the Amas in their attack on the Tau insurrectionists. The Tau were again defeated.

Miraculously, the next century-and-a-half passed more or less without incident. The IFS proved to have a fairly hands-off approach in governance, and eventually began to pay reparations to the Tau and Amas for the carnage of the First Terran War - then called the Terran War.

As time went on, and the Terran consolidated human power in the IFS governing bodies, the exies began to grow increasingly dissatsified with IFS control. A highly virulent strain of Variola major - a disease to which exies are conveniently immune - was introduce to the Meyek biosphere, and nearly all of the human colonists there died.

The IFS tracked down the source of the disease - anti-human activists on Avis - and declared martial law on the planet. A violent revolution erupted, the IFS troopers on the planet slaughtered. The Tau left the IFS within weeks, and a military intervention above the planet ended in utter ruin for the IFS fleet. The Tau and Amas joined the Avis and Meyek and formed the Second Insurrection. The war stretched on for a decade - only the sheer volume of humanity was enough to keep the exies at bay.

The war ended in a holocaust. With the cooperation of the Terran resistance on Avis, the IFS delivered twelve Advent Horizon-class orbital bombardment platforms to the planet’s orbit and bombed the planet’s surface into unrecognizability. The entire enemy command hierarchy was killed, sending the Second Insurrection into disarray. They collapsed within weeks, as word of the devastation spread. The Terran Wars were over, and IFS control over known space solidified.

In the years since the Second Terran War, the IFS’s power has begun to erode. The rise of corporate-controlled systems and new autocracies on the outer edges of known space has diminished the power the IFS enjoyed in centuries past, and the exies are again growing unruly. Humanity’s great defender is on the brink of collapse.

# Politics
**Representative body:** Most Terran consider themselves to be under the banner of the IFS. However, the Eza Syndicate, Ienet and Olea Corporations and its citizens are largely outside of IFS control.

**Interspecies relationships: Tau:** The relationship between humanity and the Tau is a testy one. The Tau respect the sheer ferocity of the human race, but have grown increasingly unhappy with their subjugation under the IFS.

**Interspecies relationships: Amas:** IFS control over the Amas having been less oppressive than control by the Tau and Solari, the Amas are merely dismissive of the human race and its government, considering them an annoyance that will soon pass.

**Interspecies relationships: Solari:** The Solari have seen the worst of the human race. Decreasing in number and unable to mount a rebellion against the IFS, the Solari have been forced to sit and watch their planet rest under foreign control for centuries. The occasional Solari will cooperate with a human, but generally consider themselves superior to the Terran. This tendency sees many humans deride them as conceited and arrogant.

**Interspecies relationships: Avis:** The IFS, having more or less depopulated the Avis homeworld, is not on good terms with the now-itenerant alien race. Many of them have defected to the Eza Syndicate and settled the outer edges of known space, where IFS control is fleeting.
# Terran in gameplay
**Attribute scores:** Humans receive no bonuses to their attribute scores, but on the other hand, don’t receive any penalties either. They are true jacks-of-all-trades, but as the adage goes, masters of none.

**Bonus Traits:** Humans receive the Human trait upon character creation.

**Humans as PC’s and NPCs:** Most players will elect to play as human, and  their versatility as heroes, adventurers and villains is matched by their versatility in interstellar politics.
