# Standard Abilities
Most abilities are not linked to any particular class. They feature a wide variety of prerequisites, and confer both active and passive bonuses.

## Adrenaline Rush
Nothing like a brush with death to get the heart a-pumping. When your health drops below 50%, you receive a +5 bonus to Constitution, as well as the +5 HP that bonus temporarily confers.

## All-Out Attack
With single-minded resolve and dedication, you can concentrate your efforts on a chosen opponent, receiving a bonus to all attack and defense rolls against that opponent. At the same time, you are unable to defend from or attack another target.

*Rank I*: +3 to Attack and Defense vs. chosen enemy.

*Rank II*: +5 to Attack and Defense vs. chosen enemy.

*Rank III*: +7 to Attack and Defense vs. chosen enemy.

## Armor Focus
Choose a model of armor with which you have grown proficient. Specializing allows you to use it with increased efficiency, maximizing your personal mobility as well as the armor’s damage-reducing qualities.

*Rank I*: You receive a +1 bonus to Dodge and all damage resistances while using this armor.

*Rank II*: You receive an additional +1 bonus to Dodge and all damage resistances while using this armor, to a total of +2.

*Rank III*: You receive an additional +1 bonus to Dodge and all damage resistances while using this armor, to a total of +3.

## Armor Proficiency
Choose a class of armor with which you are not proficient. Proficiency allows its use without the -3 non-proficiency penalty.

Only one of either Unarmed Combat and Mêlée Weapons must meet the skill requirement for Attack on the Run to be selected. If the other does not meet the requirement, Attack on the Run cannot be used with that skill.

## Blind Fire
You are able to fire at an enemy while concealed behind cover, taking a substantial penalty to accuracy, but without openly exposing yourself to enemy fire. No attempt can be made to aim the weapon.
