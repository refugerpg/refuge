There are four regions in the section of the galaxy called Known Space, consisting of nearly twenty planets, from the icy Aile to the hellish Tau. All of them, along with their histories, are detailed here.
# Regions
## Core region
The Core region has been the epicenter of cultural and political power in known space for hundreds of years before the Terran Wars. Eza was unpopulated and mostly undiscovered until a splinter group colonized it during the latter half of the Terran Wars. The widespread corruption and gangster politics spread to Lerua.

**Systems:** Solari, Keth, Eza, Lerua, Alcesar, New Haven

## Colonial region
The Colonial region, lying on the outside of known space, was the last to be colonized by alien cultures, the first to reach other galaxies and the first to be invaded by the Terran during the first days of the Terran Wars. Meyek and Aile were largely forgotten after the war, but Icre/Avis became a cultural epicenter following the holocaust on it sister planet’s surface.
**Systems:** Aile, Renve, Meyek, Icre/Avis, Olea, Geatine

## Old region
The Old region is home to the ancestral homeworlds of the Tau and Amas, as well as Telren, where some assert the Avis originated. This region has seen some of the worst of the First and Second Terran Wars, and has been held in the clenched fist of the IFS ever since.
**Systems:** Amas, Tau, Telren

## Mining region
The Mining region only started to be colonized in the midst of the Second Terran War, when the immense war machine of the IFS sought to extend its claims in case of a forced retreat from Solari. Since then, the Mining region has become a bustling industrial center of known space, as well as home to Ienet, a new power on the interstellar stage…
**Systems:** Caal, Ienet, Selus, Ulread
