Telren is one of the Old Worlds, in a section of space known to have been colonized by one species or another since the dawn of interstellar travel. Home to no native intelligences of its own, Telren is now a bustling trade world, due to its relatively close proximity to Amas, Tau, Solari and Icre/Avis, all bastion worlds of the Interplanetary Federation of Systems.

This central location made it a last line of defense for the IFS’ capital world of Solari during the Second Terran War. As AMD-equipped craft were more or less unable to travel more than a single jump without refueling, having a supply infrastructure on the surface was key to the Second Insurrection’s advance. Besieged from almost all sides by SI forces, the planet managed to withstand the attack on its surface, despite the best attempts of SI saboteurs to dislodge the IFS forces stationed there. The IFS used the planet during Reconstruction as a access point to the systems of the late SI, in the meantime bestowing upon it considerable economic growth; it quickly became the de facto trade hub of the Old Region.

Telren is home to Eberhard & Stafford, the famed weapons manufacturer, which has maintained operations on the planet since its establishment in the midst of the Second Terran War as an armorer for IFS forces there, as well as a number of shipping organizations.

These organizations are run by several dozen families (mostly human, but with a handful of Avis dynasties interspersed among them), each with billions of credits at their disposal. They dabble in a number of industries ranging from the legal – industrial goods, technology - to the licensed – weapons, ammunition, medical goods – to the less-than-legal stims that hold billions in thrall across known space.

Telren itself is represented in the IFS by the Telren Council, a loose confederation of nation-states that finds itself agreeing on little other the defense of the planet from the exies on neighboring Amas and Tau, preferably on the IFS’s dime.

Two of these nations are the Tennerines (several nations in the same geographical region) and the state of Capion.

The Tennerines are politically unstable and an ecological disaster zone – desertification has seen the great Tennerine Desert consume increasingly vast portions of the nation-state’s arable land to the north and west in recent years. A bloody civil war has risen between the IFS-backed Telren Council and the Tennerine Independence Army.

Capion has been, on the other hand, blessed with both rich agricultural and industrial resources. Despite being relatively small compared to many of the other nation-states of the Telren Council, Capion has all but surpassed its peers in wealth, resources and political clout.

As such, it is home to many of the wealthiest of the shipping families, with vast compounds – blurring the line between homes and small towns, each stretching dozens of miles in every direction and staffed by hundreds of armed guards and servants.

Compared to the poverty of the Tennerines, Capion and its inhabitants are wealthy beyond imagination. But such is the way of things...
