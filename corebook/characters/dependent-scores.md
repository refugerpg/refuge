Associated with each of the six attributes and further modified by a character’s class selection are dependent scores—Abilities, Action Points, Hit Points, Skills, Traits and Assistance. Each of these scores has a profound impact on a character’s abilities and performance in a variety of fields.

# Abilities
Modified by a character’s Dexterity score, Abilities are combat-centric maneuvers and techniques that expand the range of actions a character is able to perform during combat and improve upon a character’s combat expertise. Abilities are covered in considerably more detail, along with Traits, in Chapter Five.

# Action points
As Abilites dictate the range of actions a character is able to perform,  Action Points dictate the number of actions a character is able to perform (in a given round of combat). Most characters have between five and fifteen action points, receiving more with higher Agility scores.

# Hit points
Hit Points determine a character’s ability to withstand physical trauma, and are largely determined in kind by a character’s Constitution score. When characters reach 0 Hit Points (hereafter abbreviated as HP), they are unconscious. Characters below 0 HP lose an additional 1 HP per round, until they reach a negative value equivalent to their Constitution score, at which point they expire.

# Skills
Skills represent characters’ competence in a variety of fields of expertise, anywhere from aiming to intimidation. Each is associated with a single attribute score, and receives bonuses or penalties based on characters’ innate qualities. Characters are able to invest points into their skills at a rate commensurate to their Intelligence score and their class’s base rate.

There are two different kinds of skills, universal skills and standard skills. All characters have some innate level of ability in universal skills, while standard skills are more specialized, and based on their class. These so-called class skills can receive the full bonus conferred by a character’s relevant attribute modifier. The benefit allowed to other skills, skills that are neither class skills nor universal skills, is capped at half of the relevant attribute modifier (a negative modifier still applies the full negative score).

Nearly all skill rolls are performed by rolling 1d10 and adding a character’s skill score and their modifier. Various miscellaneous and situational modifiers are then added.

# Traits
Traits are the more character-centric counterpart to Abilities. While usually conferring bonuses to skill rolls and to characters in the situations they encounter, Traits can also be used to adopt non-class skills as class skills.
The number of traits a character acquires is based on his or her class’s Trait score, as well as his or her Perception score.
