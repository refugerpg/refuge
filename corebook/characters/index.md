# Character creation
Players need characters before being able to participate in a game session. Follow the next steps and fill out a character sheet to record your character.
Generate attribute scores

All characters have six scores that represent basic qualities inherent in everyone. These attributes—Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence, Perception and Charisma—range from 1 - 10,  with 5 an average score. High scores provide bonuses, low scores inflict penalties. These will be assigned during class selection. Attributes are described in greater detail later in this chapter.

## Select a species
All characters are one of several species, listed in the chapter on Species. Each species grants various penalties and

## Select a class
All characters have a class, a rough category into which players can sort their character to provide a baseline for mechanical character progression. Generally, assigning attribute scores is done concurrently with class selection. Classes are explained in more depth in the chapter Classes.
Determine dependent scores

Once a character class is selected, players can then determine the Dependent Scores that are determined by a combination of their Attributes and their Class’s own baseline scores.

## Select abilities, traits and skills
After generating Dependent Scores, players can then choose Abilities, Traits and Skills for their characters. These are described in greater detail during their respective chapters.

## Determine background and equipment
Before putting the final touches on characters, players can randomly determine the backgrounds of their characters—these are detailed in Chapter Three—and select their characters’ belongings and starting equipment from Chapter Eight.

Determining a character’s background is a good way of establishing the first bits of information with which to create your character. The species and homeworld of a character, their socioeconomic status and the faction with which they’re associated all provide useful information when it comes to starting an adventure.
