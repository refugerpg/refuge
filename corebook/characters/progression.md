Upon completing quests or vanquishing foes, characters receive experience points that represent their relative level of accomplishment in their chosen field. A level-one Soldier has likely just graduated from basic training and has yet to see the front lines, while a level-twenty Soldier is a grizzled veteran, with a vast wealth of experience in his or her field.

Given a certain level, finding the experience required uses the formula *XP = Level<sup>2</sup> &times; 25.*
