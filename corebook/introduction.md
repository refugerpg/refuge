Five hundred years after humanity fled a devastated Earth, the IFS has begun to crumble, losing ground to the criminal syndicates, ruthless corporations and new autocracies on its fringes. Impassively, the exies wait as their longtime oppressors’ federation collapses. The fate of humanity has never seemed bleaker.

Welcome to Refuge.

Though the default setting for the Refuge RPG is covered in depth in later chapters, the core conflict resolution system is useable for nearly any RPG in a modern or futuristic setting. Abilities, items and skills can be tweaked by the game master to fit a particular genre more closely—from military sci-fi to more traditional space-opera, gritty cyberpunk to survival horror. For these settings and more, the Refuge RPG offers a modular, flexible ruleset.

# System Architecture
The Refuge RPG is designed to be a modular system. As the default system can be quite complex, parts of the game system that are irrelevant to the type of game you wish to run can be safely discarded without dramatically upsetting the game’s balance.

The only absolutely crucial elements of the Refuge RPG are the core rolling mechanic, Attributes and Dependent Scores (i.e. Abilities, AP, HP, Skills, Traits and Assistance). Abilities, Traits and Skills can be modified to fit a setting more closely, while even the class system can be disregarded if desired. Appendix 2 is concerned with such restructuring of the game’s core mechanics.

# Reading This Book
This book contains all the information needed to run a game session of the Refuge RPG.

1. **Introduction**: This chapter offers an introduction to the various elements of the Refuge RPG, a short overview of the book’s contents, a glossary of commonly-used terms and a short guide to character creation.
2. **Characters**: There are six Attributes in the Refuge RPG, each reflecting the most basics aspects of characters and their abilities - his or her Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence, Perception and Charisma. These six Attributes form the foundation for a character’s interaction with the world. The Refuge RPG contains six character classes, each associated with one of the six Attributes, and each with a distinct roles in a party of adventuring characters. Classes dictate a number of character statistics and access to Abilites, Skills and Traits, which increase as characters gain experience and levels.
3. **Skills**: Each character has access to a variety of different fields of expertise, ranging from firearm handling to dodging attacks to hacking computers. From the twenty-four skills, each character is considered trained in the six Universal skills as well as the three other skills dictated by his or her class, with the opportunity to train in other skills.
4. **Abilities & Traits**: Abilities and Traits offer other means of character customization - Abilities are generally combat manuevers and techniques that offer particular bonuses or situational abilities, while Traits are aspects of a character’s personality that manifest in stat bonuses or simply offer additional role-playing opportunities.
5. **Items & Equipment**: Weapons, armor, gadgets, equipment and medical supplies can dramatically change a character’s experience.  This chapter
6. **Craft & Vehicles**
7. **Combat**: Very little of known space could be accurately described as "pleasant". Nearly all characters who seek a life of adventure, will end up in the line of fire at one time or another. The rules dictating combat between characters or craft in the Refuge Role-Playing Game are outlined here.
8. **Travel & Trading**: The livelihood for a good number of characters is in the trading and shipping game, and even those who don’t directly benefit from it aren’t immune to its importance in their daily lives. This chapter provides information and rules about economics in the Refuge Role-Playing Game.
9. **Setting**: The default setting for the Refuge Role-Playing Game extends over nearly two dozen planets and eight centuries of fictional history. All of the events, characters, factions and locales covered in some depth here.
10. **Advanced Classes**:
11. **Friends & Foes**:
12. **Campaigns**: Some episodes in the history of the Refuge universe make for particularly rich role-playing experiences, and can be used by Gamemasters unfamiliar with creating their own campaigns. Each offers a suggested plot outline, as well as lists of friends and foes that may be encountered in the course of the adventure.
13. **Gamemastering**: Some information is much more relevant to the person running the game session than it is to the people playing it. Awarding experience, running combat encounters, suggestions for streamlining or modifying gameplay to fit the needs of a group, sample NPCs, etc., are all covered here.

## Running a Game
In order to run a game of Refuge, a group should have several players, sufficient quantities of paper, polyhedral dice and writing implements and a GM to serve as an arbiter. Of course, before starting a campaign, players must create characters and establish a starting point of-sorts for the campaign.

## Dice and Nomenclature
As in most role-playing games, conflict resolution in the Refuge RPG is performed with a roll of dice. Dice rolls are performed when characters perform activities with unassured odds of success.

Dice are referred to by their number of sides: a d4 is a four-sided dice, a d8 an eight-sided one. Skill rolls, for instance, are performed with a ten-sided die, the d10. With the exception of the d20, all traditional polyhedral dice make appearances in the Refuge RPG.

In rolls using multiple dice of the same value, the number of dice rolled is appended to the beginning of the die number. A player instructed to roll ‘3d10’ would roll three ten-sided dice (or one ten-sided die three times), and return the total value.

Dice rolls are occasionally modified with constants to be added or subtracted to and from totals. These are indicated with a plus or minus after the dice number, followed by the value of the constant. To roll 3d4-2, a player would roll three four-sided dice, and subtract two from the total count.

# Glossary
There are a fairly intimidating number of concepts in the Refuge RPG for those inexperienced with role-playing games. A short listing of those concepts, names, abbreviations, etc., follows here.

- Ability: A combat maneuver or technique, selected upon level-up. the number of Abilities available to a character is dictated by their class and Dexterity score.
- Action Points: A discrete unit of time (1 AP is roughly equal to half a second), given to a character to distribute among actions during their turn. Different actions have different AP costs. AP regenerates at the beginning of a character’s turn.
- Attribute: One of six scores (Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence, Perception, Charisma) that dictates a character’s basic abilities. These have a trickle-down effect to most of a character’s statistics.
-	Check: A generic term for an unopposed dice roll - i.e., a dice roll performed with a d10 against some score determined by the GM.
-	Class: Classes are archetypical roles taken by characters. There are six core classes - Soldier, Scout, Support, Techie, Spacer and Ambassador, each associated with an Attribute score and imparting its own benefits and statistics to a character.
-	Difficulty Score: A score used by the GM as a benchmark by which to test a character’s skills. A character must meet or exceed a DS to succeed at a check.
-	Experience Points (XP): As characters complete quests, overcome foes and learn and grow as individuals, they receive experience points.  Once a character has accumulated a given number of experience points, he or she gains a level and is granted new or improved abilities.
-	Game Master (GM): The person who controls the game world for the session - the arbiter of rules and creator of challenges for players to overcome.
-	Hit Points: The amount of physical trauma a character is able to withstand before expiring. Unlike in many role-playing games, hit points do not increase with increased experience - a veteran is just as vulnerable to a sniper’s bullet as a rookie is, but odds are a veteran will be better at avoiding it in the first place.
-	Level: A character’s level represents his or her experience and power. High-level characters have been around the block, where low-level characters are new recruits, ingenues or simply inexperienced.
- Modifier: A bonus or penalty to a skill roll.
-	Non-Player Character (NPC): A character controlled by the GM. An NPC could be an enemy, an ally or anything in-between.
-	Player Character (PC): A character controlled by a participant in the gaming session.
-	Round: The time it takes for all characters involved in combat to take a turn.
-	Skill: A field of expertise, ranging from the mundane - using a computer, firing a gun, to the impressive - piloting a craft, healing the wounded.
-	Status effect: A temporary condition that imparts some benefit or penalty to a character’s abilities.
-	Turn: An amount of time equal to a character’s Action Points. Actions are performed until no Action Points remain, at which point the next character’s turn is taken.

# Creating a Character
Players need characters before being able to participate in a game session. Follow the next steps and fill out a character sheet to record your character.

1. Generate Attribute Scores: All characters have six scores that represent basic qualities inherent in everyone. These attributes—Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence, Perception and Charisma—range from 1 - 10,  with 5 an average score. High scores provide bonuses, low scores inflict penalties. These will be assigned during class selection. Attributes are described in greater detail in the second chapter.
2. Select a Species:
3. Select a Class: All characters have a class, a rough category into which players can sort his or her character to provide a baseline for mechanical character progression. Generally, assigning attribute scores is done concurrently with class selection. Classes are explained in more depth in Chapter Four.
4. Determine Dependent Scores: Once a character class is selected, players can then determine the Dependent Scores that are determined by a combination of their Attributes and their Class’s own baseline scores.
5. Select Abilities, Traits and Skills: After generating Dependent Scores, players can then choose Abilities, Traits and Skills for their characters. These are described in greater detail during their respective chapters.
6. Determine Character Background and Equipment: Before putting the final touches on characters, players can randomly determine the backgrounds of their characters—these are detailed in Chapter Three—and select their characters’ belongings and starting equipment from Chapter Eight.

# Character Creation
Determining a character’s background is a good way of establishing the first bits of information with which to create your character. ASDF the species and homeworld of a character, his or her socioeconomic status and the faction with which they are associated all provide useful information when it comes to starting an adventure.
