title: Craft and vehicles

Commonly known to pilots and landsmen alike as merely “craft,” spacecraft are key to interplanetary and interstellar travel alike.
It’s not easy work, nor is it safe. Space is big. Very big. If the navigation computer makes a bad calculation, if one engine is funneling 1 tenth of one percent more fuel out of one side than the computer reports, a craft might end up billions or trillions of miles off course with no way to return.
But there’s money in it for those willing to take the risk...

# Craft Characteristics
## Attributes
A craft operates with the same fundamental attributes (Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence, Perception and Charisma) as an individual. While the metaphor of craft-as-character is not perfect, it allows vehicular combat and game logic trumps story logic in this instance.

**Dexterity:** While generally illegal, craft often have offensive capabilities of some sort. Craft with high Dexterity scores will receive bonuses to Aim, as well as bonuses to larger numbers of Abilities.

**Agility:** Agility measures a craft’s ability to perform complex maneuvers within minimal time frames. Craft with high dexterity receive bonuses to Dodge and their Action Points reserve.

**Constitution:** Constitution measures a craft’s ability to withstand accumulated damage in the form of HP, and the ability to withstand catastrophic damage in the form of Fortitude.

**Intelligence:** All craft have computer systems of varying power; Intelligence reflects a craft’s ability to automate complex routines and maneuvers, and to combat electronic warfare suites.

**Perception:** Craft with high Perception scores have access to powerful sensor suites capable of detecting craft at long ranges, and detecting incoming missiles and ordnance.

## Dependent Scores
All craft also have six dependent scores, dictating their maneuvers, speed and agility, characteristics and traits.
Abilities: Abilities dictate additional combat maneuvers and actions a craft can take; it’s determined by a craft’s Dexterity score.
Action Points: The number of actions a craft is able to take over the course of a turn is dictated by its number of Action Points, which is in turn determined by a craft’s Agility score.
Hit Points: The amount of damage a craft is able to sustain before breaking up is dictated by its hit point, based on its Constitution score.
Skills: Likewise, craft have points dedicated into each of the six universal skills - Aim, Dodge, Fortitude, Willpower, Awareness and Persuade.
Aim: The effectiveness of a craft’s onboard targeting systems.
Dodge: The ability of a craft to avoid being struck by incoming projectiles and missiles.
Fortitude: The resilience of a craft to traumatic structural damage.
Willpower: A craft’s onboard computer systems’ ability to wage electronic warfare against other craft.
Awareness: The sensitivity of a craft’s onboard sensor suites.
Persuade: A craft’s ability to successfully juke and feint enemies.
Traits: A craft’s quirks and individual peculiarities can be dictated by Traits; the number of Traits a craft has is determined by its Perception score.
