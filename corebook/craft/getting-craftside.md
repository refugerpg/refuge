# Acquiring a Craft

There are several ways to acquire a craft, and several more to acquire it legally. One of the most obvious ways is to simply purchase one from a primary or secondary market. This is probably the cheapest option, but also offers the least flexibility for craft layout and interior design.

Otherwise, numerous businesses and corporations will work with clients to produce schematics for a craft, which they will then produce. This is an expensive process, but is the only way to acquire a craft truly built to its owners’ specifications.

If all else fails, stealing a craft may be an option, if also one that will make it incredibly difficult to operate openly in civilized space. Paying a down-payment on a craft and simply refusing to pay the rest will incur the wrath of a corporation, and they will make every attempt to repossess its property, informing local authorities in the process. Boarding a craft, killing or otherwise disposing of the crew and riding off into the sunset is a similarly dangerous option, though also a viable one.

Beyond that, acquiring a craft is likely to be a story-driven occurrence. Perhaps the party receives an offer from a mysterious figure who’ll offer one as the payment for a dangerous job. Or they’re the employees of a corp or government and the craft is provided for their use. Ultimately, there’s no shortage of ways to get a craft for the player characters; it’s a matter of giving it a tangible cost to the adventurers.

# Purchasing a craft
Numerous primary and secondary markets exist for spacecraft, most of them on hub worlds - Telren, Solari, Olea and Selus, in the Old, Core, Colonial and Mining Regions, respectively. The Olea Corp. Craftyards is a prominent example. A number of craft and craft designs are available for purchase, some more time-tested than others.

Older-model craft, with fewer licensing costs incurred on the part of the manufacturers and familiar design patterns for the builders, are generally much cheaper to purchase than bleeding-edge craft built from brand new schematics, where licensing fees from craft houses can stretch well into the tens of thousands of credits.

Craft older than fifty years will certainly be available, but probably not from a craftyard or reseller. A prospective buyer will have to dig deep in the secondary markets to find that.

# Financing a craft
Few are able to afford to pay for a craft outright; those who can will probably not be the heroes of your campaign. For the more financially-challenged heroes, financing the craft is the only legal option. Regardless of financing plan, however, the makers of a craft will almost always require a substantial downpayment of 10%-25%, depending on the cost of the craft and the naïveté of the seller.

Depending on the location, the repute of the debtor and the repute of the financier, a number of interests will be offered, from the merely painful to the downright extortionate. As craft are rarely within systems on a monthly basis, financiers typically require six payments twice-yearly.

A formula for calculating biannual payments P on a loan of L credits for n biannual periods at an interest rate of c is as follows:

Defaulting on a loan is an unpleasant experience, and generally ends in the owner - i.e. the financier - repossessing the craft. As craft are multimillion credit investments, a financier will stop at nothing to retrieve his or her property, and will likely inform local authorities and/or hire bounty hunters to retrieve it.

# Commissioning a craft
For the particularly wealthy or standards-driven client, having a craft bespoken (i.e. made-to-order) is probably the best option. It is, however, considerably more complicated than acquiring a used or pre-made craft.

A wide variety of craft patterns exist on the open market, ranging from cutting-edge designs intended only for the most exclusive owners to century-old designs that have slipped into the public domain. Most craft-yards are familiar to with these designs, and can often produce them at a discount.

For a truly custom craft, a craft house must be contacted and hired to produce the schematics for a craft. These design houses do not come cheap, and typically charge 1-2% of the final cost for the craft. These generally do not have financing options, and take anywhere from one to four months to complete.

After acquiring the design schematics, a client must commission a craft-yard to produce the craft itself. Most bespoke craft well-exceed the 175,000 credit mark per metric ton, and often reach 250,000 credits per metric ton or more, depending on the quality of the craft-yard. A craft scraping the 100 million credit mark is not unheard of in the upper echelons of private craft manufacturing.

# Designing a custom craft

A craft is assigned points more or less like a character. Scores typically range from 1-10, 1 indicating a barely-functioning attribute, to 10, making the craft a textbook example of that attribute at its best.

A craft’s attributes can be rolled - again, as 3d4-2 - or assigned non-randomly. For gamemasters choosing that latter path, small craft have 24 points to distribute to attribute scores, large craft have 36.

After assigning attribute scores, the gamemaster or players have two different paths to take when it comes to designing a craft. The craft can be given a dedicated layout or simply described by its component systems, leaving it to the players to imagine the craft. Both are perfectly legitimate options, though the first has quite a bit more overhead for whoever takes the role of architect, while the  second may run into problems with high-combat campaigns, or campaigns where boarding is a likelihood.

Designing a craft is a matter of incorporating (1)  the desired systems into a (2) desired frame of a given size, while respecting (3) the power requirements for and (4) thermal discharge of those systems and (5) cost.

If a diagram is to be made, one meter = one square is a good starting size. For frame designs, a 2x2x3 square is roughly equal to one ton of frame weight.
