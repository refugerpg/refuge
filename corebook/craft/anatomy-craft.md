title: Anatomy of a craft
author: "Noah Lange"

Craft at their most basic can be broken down into a frame, a hull and any number of internal modules. modules can be any number of component systems for a craft - life support, power, propulsion, sensor arrays, weapon hardpoints, &c. The number of modules a craft can hold is dictated by the size of the craft.

Each module has a number of characteristics. Depending on its type and quality, a module can modify the attributes of a craft, its skills, improve its resistance to damage, or any number of things. Note that not all of these characteristics will be available for each module - armor plating cannot possibly be expected to produce power for a craft, for instance.

**Attribute bonuses:** Powerful engines, thick armor, &c., will provide bonuses to a craft’s primary attributes.

**Dimensions:** Dimensions are given as both whole numbers and pairs of numbers. For a craft without a drawn or otherwise diagrammed internal design, whole numbers can be used to determine the amount of room a given module takes up from the internal dimensions of the frame. Craft with a diagram can use the number pairs to help organize a floor plan.

**Power input:** Electrically-powered modules have power requirements (listed here in MW), though many can be run on low-power settings or shut off entirely to help reduce thermal production or reallocate reactor power.

**Power output:** Fusion reactors, solar panels, or even the odd old fission reactor generate reliable power for a craft and its systems. Power output measures the power production of one of these modules in MW.

**Resistance bonuses:** Largely restricted to armor and craft frames, resistances bonuses are a list of the various  damage resistances (to Ballistic, Chemical, Energy, Mêlée and Thermal) armor plating or an infrastructural component imparts.

**Skill bonuses:** Many craft systems provide bonuses to the six craft skills - Aim, Dodge, Fortitude, Willpower, Awareness and Persuade. Engines with high thrusts will improve a craft’s dodge rolls, electronic countermeasure suites will improve resistance to hacking attempts, etc.

**Thermal input:** All heat sinks and radiators have specific amounts of thermal energy they can successfully dissipate.

**Thermal output:** Nearly all electrically-powered internal modules for a craft will have some effect on its thermal profile. Life support suites, reactors, weapons systems, will all produce waste heat that must be carefully radiated, lest the crew be burned alive inside the hull.

# Frame
The superstructure for a craft, frames determine the general layout for a craft and its interior. The size of a frame dictates the number of modules a craft can hold. Larger craft have more modules, and cost more as their size increases.

**Hull:** The hull of a craft performs a number of roles. Primarily, it keeps the air inside the craft inside, and protects the contents of a craft from rapidly-moving particles, orbital refuse, radiation and enemy projectiles. The hull also must have various exit and entrance points for the crew and cargo, as well as heat dispersal technology to radiate waste heat. A number of different hulls are available, sorted by material and cost. Each will provide different bonuses and penalties for craft.

**Streamlining:** In order to operate in atmospheric conditions—atmo—, a craft requires external aerodynamic streamlining. Most craft, especially larger ones, remain spacebound from building to breaking, though many smaller craft can and do enter atmo for various activities. Streamlining a custom craft incurs additional costs (+10%) to its schematic price.

# Structural modules
Many craft are of distinctly modular design. Modularity is a fairly easy way to achieve the compartmentalization needed to minimize damage from decompression incidents. Having bridges, cargo-bays and CICs all built from prefabrications makes the design and construction of craft considerably easier, though they are by no means required for a custom-built craft. Structural modules take up space and offer places for additional modules - typically system modules - to be inserted.

**Airlock:** Apart from being a convenient method of execution, airlocks provide an invaluable role in craft-to-craft interactions, allowing people, objects and cargo to be transferred from one craft to another.

**Armor:** Shields are invaluable to protect the hull from damage. Many craft use multiple types of armor shielding to prevent damage. No regenerating shield technology exists; it must all eventually be replaced at great cost to the owner.

**Ablative armor:** Ablative armor prevents damage to a craft’s hull by being destroyed in its place. It provides considerable protection, especially against micrometeoroids and space-borne refuse, but requires regular replacement.

**Composite armor:** All vehicles use composite armor to one extent or another. Using a variety of materials - aluminum, beryllium or other alloys, often hardened with carbon, tungsten disulfide and boron nitride nanotubes - in layers to distribute impact.

**Reactive armor:** There are a number of reactive armor technologies available, and both in common use in civilian and military craft. NERA (non-explosive reactive armor) dissipates impact energy by distributing it through a layer of inert material sandwiched between metallic alloy plating which bulges and “thickens” the armor at the point of impact. EMRA (electromagnetic reactive armor) is also popular, but requires a dedicated power source - the armor is charged with a high-voltage power source, which discharges energy into incoming projectiles, often converting them into plasma, which creates its own problems.

# Craft interior

**Bridge:** All craft require a location from which the craft is able to be controlled. Containing an astrionics suite - often alongside an avionics suite for craft that can operate in atmo - an FPC controller, sensor readouts, communication units, as well as flight computers, the bridge is traditionally located at the bow of the craft, so as to have a good view of the proceedings for atmospheric maneuvers and docking procedures. Exclusively space-bound craft generally have centrally-located bridges with artificial visualizations of the craft's surroundings.

**Cargo bay:** Most craft have places to store cargo within their own superstructure. Cargo bays generally have large airlocks through which cargo can be easily transferred.

**Combat information center:** Nearly all military craft and smaller craft with tendencies to get into trouble have dedicated combat information centers (CIC). The CIC is the primary tactical decision-making center for the craft. This is generally kept in a central location, with the intention of keeping the command crew out of harm’s way if at all possible.

**Engine room:** Any craft with a desire to stay in operation will have some manner of an engine room. Located close to a craft’s engines and in all likelihood, its main reactor, an engine room provides a good central location for maintenance and general upkeep of a craft’s main thrusters.

**Factory:** Some larger craft may have built-in factories for the construction of goods from raw materials mined or otherwise gathered while in space.

**Hangar bay:** Larger craft may have an integrated hangar bay, capable of storing small craft or vehicles.

**Hydroponics labL** Hydroponics labs are often installed in larger ships to offset oxygen storage requirements and CO2 scrubber load, but more importantly to provide fresh food for the crew. The increasing speed of AMDs have relegated these to more expensive or slower craft.

**Medical bay:** Craft with long-term transit routes, or craft with tendencies to get into tangles, would be well-advised to keep both a craftboard medic as well as a dedicated medical bay for the medic to work and take care of infirm or wounded passengers or crew.

**Passenger and crew quarters:** Any craft that has a crew needs a place to keep them. Passenger and crew quarters can be of many varieties, from naval-style berths to more spacious and accommodating staterooms.

**Reactor room:** Virtually all craft generate their power with either nuclear fusion or fission reactors. In order to contain reactor leaks and other nightmare scenarios, reactors and their associated equipment are typically kept in a well-sealed module of their own, generally toward the center of the craft.

**Refinery:** Larger mining craft have their own internal refineries for extracting ore from raw materials. These generally have high power requirements, but can furnish fuels to power a craft’s thrusters.

**Storage:** Oxygen, water, fuel, food and heat sink coolant are the five most important resources to a craft and its crew, and as a result have dedicated storage space apart from the normal cargo bay.

# System modules
System modules are individual subsystems of a craft, instead of compartmentalized sections within a craft. Generally, system modules are located within or anchored to structural modules, and provide bonuses to a craft’s skills.

**Alcubierre Metric Drive:** Named after the twentieth-century Mexican astrophysicist who established the theoretical basis for the drive, the Alcubierre metric drive makes travel at several hundred times the speed of light possible.

Enclosing the vessel in a “warp bubble,” the AMD warps spacetime in a wave-like pattern around itself, contracting spacetime before it and expanding spacetime behind it. The warp bubble rides this wave at extraordinary velocities, while the contents of the bubble itself remain stationary. Creating and dissolving this bubble require vast amounts of energy, making an AMD one of the primary sources of power consumption aboard most craft.

Several models of the AMD are manufactured by a handful of corporations, classified by the intensity of the warp effect surrounding the AMD. Earlier marks are considerably more stable than later, faster AMDs—the tidal forces on the outer edges of the warp bubble increase dramatically with the magnitude of contraction and expansion around the AMD.

The horrifying consequences of failure—in the best of circumstances, a botched jump destroys the AMD and deposits the craft in the middle of deep space (for this reason, low mark backup AMDs are often installed on larger craft)—and in the worst, the collapsing warp bubble violently tears the craft and its passengers to pieces without warning—has allowed allowed the slower and more reliable Mark AMDs to remain popular in the transport of high-value cargo and passengers, despite the substantially decreased transit times of more advanced drives.

Mk IV AMDs are under extraordinarily strict regulation by the IFS and only used in bleeding-edge experimental craft.
AMDs are highly temperamental and their safe use requires constant monitoring of gravity wells that could provoke an inadvertent drop. Nearly all AMD drives—illegally modified ones excepted—are manufactured with jump locks that prevent the engagement of an AMD drive within a certain proximity of a planet, satellite, gravity well or other active AMDs.

**Capacitor bank:** The amount of energy to make a jump with an Alcubierre drive is truly astronomical. To supply sufficient power for an AMD jump, craft require large capacitor banks capable of discharging vast amounts of energy within a fraction of a second.
Heat sinks and radiators

Operating a craft in space - thrusters, life support, computers, etc. - requires a vast amount of energy, and without a convenient atmosphere in which to jettison it, a craft will quickly reach temperatures unsuitable for continued human survival. Radiators are subsequently very tempting targets in space combat: a ship with even only a few destroyed radiators will be unable to continue fighting without outright killing the crew.

For that reason, retractable radiators are popular, but put a short timeline on combat. Internal heat sinks are only able to compensate for combat status in a craft for a short while; after that, temperatures will rapidly increase with weapons fire and power generation.

## Life support
Maintaining a livable atmosphere with livable air temperature and pressure is the primary goal of a life-support system. Storing water is a close second, and food a third priority.

**Food:** 2.33 kilograms of food is required per crew member per day; 2/3 kg of it frozen, 4/3 kg of it dry and 1/3 of it fresh. Hydroponics suites are popular to produce fresh food for craft crew members.

**Oxygen:** Average O2 consumption is 1 kg per person per day. Having additional oxygen in reserve is generally considered to be a sensible idea.

**Water:** Extensive craftboard water recycling allows for a good amount of water to be preserved. However, a craft should keep about 25 kg of water per person in reserve.

**Power**: Most craft are powered by fusion reactors, though fission reactors see some use in slow-moving, low-power craft. Multiple reactors may be required to power a number of modules with high energy requirements.

**Propulsion:** A number of propulsion systems are in popular use, though magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters are far and away the most popular, despite their high power requirements. Ion thrusters also see some use, and chemical rockets have not entirely been supplanted in transporting heavy cargo from surface to orbit.

**Sensor arrays**: There are two classes of sensors, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Passive sensor arrays merely receive information from sensors - watching, but not searching. They’re much less powerful than active sensors, but are  undetectable. Active sensors ‘ping’ their operational area with electromagnetic radiation, searching for reflections from  nearby bodies. Active sensors, while much better at detection, are also extremely effective at informing enemies of a craft’s presence. In the long run, detecting craft is an trivially easy proposition.

Even low-power drives can be seen clearly with cheap sensors at vast distances. Shutting down and ‘coasting’ is an option, but even the heat from life-support systems will make a craft stand out against the nothing of space like a moon in the night sky. In absence of a convenient asteroid to hide behind, stealth in space is more or less impossible, so space combat often becomes a matter of being the first to spot the enemy, and the first to destroy the other without cooking the crew alive.

# Ordnance
Few crews are able to acquire weapons licenses for their craft, the major exceptions being transporters of valuable ores and passengers.
That is not to suggest, however, that few craft are armed with weapons. On the fringes of known space, craft have weapons more often than not, and in space free of the IFS, craft without weapons are the exception, rather than the rule. Piracy and other unpleasantries are all-too common in space—civilized or not—and most crews find it pays to be prepared.

**Gauss:** Gauss firearms operate by accelerating a ferromagnetic projectile to high velocities through a series of electromagnets. With no moving parts and very little maintenance to be done, Gauss weapons are ideal for use against would-be boarding craft, but as with all projectile weapons, have massive issues with range. However, oncoming Gauss projectiles cannot be detected, making them quite useful if one can manage to line up an accurate shot.

**Ballistic:** Conventional ballistic arms are somewhat less popular, due to the potential for feeding and heat dispersion issues in vacuum. Ballistic projectiles suffer from the same failings as Gauss projectiles - namely, range issues - but similarly, cannot be detected.

**Missile:** Despite being fairly expensive, missiles are the most popular weapon for craft-to-craft combat, suffering none of the problems that projectile weapons have at range, and none of the weight and power supply problems faced by energy weapons.

**Concussion:** A warhead delivering an electromagnetic pulse to its target upon contact. Concussion missiles are popular as offensive and defensive weapons and incredibly effective against most non-military craft, as total EMP hardening of a craft unlikely to need it is often seen as wastefully expensive.

**Conventional:** A missile tipped with an explosive warhead. These generally employ onboard computer systems to guide itself to a target; these systems are often vulnerable to concussion missiles or ECM.

**Kinetic missile:** Kinetic missiles, or kinetic buses - often simply called ‘buses’ - rely on sheer mass and acceleration to inflict damage to targets.
Nuclear missiles: Nuclear missiles are more or less impossible to find on the open market. Some private military contractors may be able to acquire them from governmental organizations, but they remain well out-of-reach for normal citizen traders and crews.

# Offensive uses of the AMD
The potential for AMDs as offensive weapons has been obvious since their creation. The combination of tidal forces from the AMD bubble and the force from the collision with an object moving several hundred times the speed of light have been known to rend even battlecruisers into pieces.

The crews of doomed craft and kamikaze attackers—especially during the Second Terran War—have been known to attempt ‘AMD kills.’

These types of attacks are not as common as would be anticipated, and less common now than they have been in the past. AMD warp bubble generation is not instantaneous, and sensor systems have grown highly sensitive to such disturbances.

Most AMD kill attempts are detected within milliseconds, and either evaded with a micro-jump (most would-be targets of AMD kill attempts, such as high-value military craft, are using higher mark AMDs with faster jump times) or are focused down with concentrated fire before the jump can be executed.
AMD kills are a serious risk in areas where AMD jumps, even micro-jumps, are not possible or extremely dangerous—especially when the target of an attack is within the gravity well of a planet or dwarf planet. In these instances, the onus is on the crew to balance the risk of a potentially-catastrophic AMD jump with the effects of an AMD kill attempt.

**Energy weapons:** Lasers are somewhat less popular. Though they’re very accurate out to very long ranges and make—relatively speaking—immediate contact with targets, lasers are extremely bulky, expensive and require dedicated equipment for cooling and power.
