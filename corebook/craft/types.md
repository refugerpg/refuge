For the purposes of classification, ‘small’ or ‘light’ craft are in the sub-1000 metric ton range. ‘Large’ or ‘heavy’ craft weigh more than 1000 metric tons. Military craft are only available to governmental organizations, private military contractors, or as part of corporate fleets. Civilian craft are available to the general public.

# Civilian Craft
The following is not a comprehensive listing of all types of civilian craft, but is a decent starting point for one to get a feel for the types of craft fielded in known space.

# Small Civilian Craft

**Corp cruiser:** Essentially the corporation’s version of a military transport frigate, corp cruisers are relatively large (~800 tons) craft used to transport military goods and troops from system to system.

**Courier**: Couriers are responsible for getting news spread between systems another. Frequently contracted by the government, couriers will arrive at a system, drop off downloaded logs from their starting system, then retrieve an upload log and return. Other couriers act as private mail-deliverers for corps and wealthy individuals.

**Q-craft:** The IFS has been known to pay crews of Q-craft - essentially, heavily-armored craft disguised as tramp freighters - to draw out pirates and privateers for bounty. It’s a lucrative business, but also a dangerous one.

**Shuttle:** Generally small enough to dock with a spacebound freighter or transport, shuttles are small craft used to transport small amounts of cargo and passengers to and from the planet surface.

**Tramp freighter:** Usually starting at around 300 tons, tramp freighters are contract carriers: they’ll carry more or less anything to more or less anywhere, but always at a price. Reliable and sturdy, these craft are the preferred craft for free traders.

**Transport**: In other cases, passengers are the cargo. Transports typically have more palatable lodgings for passengers and crew than tramp freighters and scouts, but rarely carry extensive amounts of cargo, apart from a handful of—usually functioning—lifecraft.

**Yacht:** Particularly wealthy individuals with a flair for the dramatic may purchase yachts for interplanetary or even interstellar travel. Small but elaborate, yachts often have hidden armaments and onboard security to defend against would-be hostage-takers.

## Large Civilian Craft

**Heavy freighter:** Corporations and governmental agencies may field heavy tramp freighters to shuttle large cargos between systems. Heavy freighters are exclusively space-bound due to their size, stretching into the tens of thousands of metric tons.
Heavy freighters almost exclusively use low-mark AMDs to mitigate the increased chance of failure with faster drives.

**Passenger liner:** Populating colonial worlds or simply shuttling immigrants from one system to another, passenger liners fill the role of transports on a larger scale, transporting hundreds to thousands of passengers at a time.

# Military Craft
## Small Military Craft
**Boarder**: In the vein of a dropship, but exclusively for craft-to-craft combat, boarder craft are used to seize control of a ship from within. Small, fast and lightly armored, boarders are typically deployed in vast numbers, and destroyed by point-defense guns in similar ones.

**Bomber:** Designed to fire dumb missiles from a close distance to preclude ECM attempts, bombers are designed to close-in on an enemy craft and peel away before risking fire.

**Dropship:** Dropships move troops from one craft to another, from craft to the surface or vice versa. They’re only lightly-armed, but are fairly quick to compensate for their lack of active defense.

**FAC:** A fully-armed frigate in a freighter’s body, fast attack craft—known as FACs—are used to engage small enemy craft - from pirate freighters to enemy bombers, transports and interceptors.

**Fighter:** Fighters are used to engage and destroy smaller craft, mostly enemy bombers, but also the odd boarder they come across. Fighters are also fairly typical escort craft for transports and interceptors nearing or leaving a planet’s surface.

**Gunship:** Heavily armed, gunships are typical escort craft for dropships and play key support roles in planetary military engagements. Most are designed for both atmospheric and space combat.

**Interceptor:** Interceptors are designed to pursue, engage and disable civilian craft at close ranges, and as such are often used by police, the IFSIA, and pirates/privateers.

## Large Military Craft

**Corvette:** Fast and maneuverable, corvettes are small craft (generally smaller than frigates, but larger than FAC) used for light interceptor duty in the gravity wells around planets.

**Frigate:** A fairly generic term for a support craft, frigates are typically used as defense craft for merchant marine craft as well as shields for larger, more valuable craft in fleets.

**Destroyer:** With extensive point-defense capabilities, destroyers are primarily tasked with preventing damage to the key vessels in a fleet. This largely consists of missile interception, though occasionally smaller frigates may come close enough to merit a good-old one-two with the CIWS.

**Cruiser:** Cruisers are relatively large craft fielded as workhorse craft by most major military forces. Somewhat larger than destroyers, cruisers are primarily fielded for their power against other craft-of-the-line—from frigates to battlecruisers.

**Battlecruiser:** Larger and more powerful than cruisers, battlecruisers serve as capital craft and as powerful deterrents for would-be enemy combatants.

**Carrier:** Carriers store and field most small military craft for fleets, but are themselves rather vulnerable to attack and harm, and require support craft to stay out of harm’s way.

**Orbital bombardment platform:** Though most are technically frigates, orbital bombardment platforms have secured a niche role the fleet. Armed with dozens of Gauss cannons firing long, telephone pole-sized rods of tungsten from orbit, OBPs are capable of inflicting considerable damage on ground targets.
