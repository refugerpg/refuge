# Crews
Without a crew, a craft is merely a very expensive hulk of steel and metallic alloys filled with even more expensive hardware. Depending on the size of a craft, the number of people required to operate it to its full potential can vary - a small craft, like a bomber or escort fighter, might only require a single pilot or a pilot and co-pilot. Larger transports and freighters will likely require larger crews, due to the additional scope and complexity of onboard systems.

## Engineer
Maintaining a craft’s structural integrity, either against general wear and tear or under heavy fire from enemies, is something best left to a dedicated crew member. Any craft larger than a small escort fighter or bomber would be left extremely vulnerable without a dedicated engineer.

## Gunner
Very few craft in IFS-controlled space have (legally) installed dedicated weapons systems. Some local jurisdictions, especially those in the vicinity of Eza space, permit relatively low power Gauss weapons or ballistic cannons for defense against pirates. In those instances, and when a crew manages to have acquired some military-grade hardware of their own, a gunner may come in handy against enemy craft. A gunner takes over any one of a craft’s available weapons, and is allowed to use it as an Aim (Heavy Weapons) roll.

## Medic
The vast stretches between planetary systems can take weeks to cross; they are not ideal places to be left without medical attention. For crews with more than a handful of members, or crews with tendencies to get into tangles with pirates or boarders, having a medic is the best way to ensure everyone on the craft makes it to their destination intact.

## Navigator
A dedicated navigator can dramatically expedite the process of plotting AMD jumps. While computers can do most of the calculations, it often helps to have an expert dedicating his or her entire focus to ensuring a safe and fast jump.

## Pilot
Often, the most important member of the crew is the one behind the joysticks. In small craft, the pilot usually doubles as navigator, and in the smallest ones, possibly as an engineer. Obviously, this can make combat an extremely dangerous proposition.

## Security
Craft in hostile territory can expect to encounter all variety of hazards; a powerful electronic warfare suite can disable craft if given the opportunity, and even a wildly incompetent boarding party can spell death for a craft and its entire crew. Having security onboard can prove a potent defensive measure.
# Operating costs
Operating a craft is not cheap. Here are some of the variety of costs that may be incurred over the course of a craft’s operational lifetime.

## Food
Feeding a craft’s crew and passengers can be expensive or cheap, depending on where and from whom one happens to procure the food. See Chapter Nine: Travel and Trading for more information.

## Fines
Having a craft fall apart in the skies over a civilian center can be hazardous for the public health. Improper operation or maintenance of a craft, engaging or disengaging an AMD too close to a gravity well or any number of unlawful actions may incur the displeasure of the IFS or local governments, ranging from the hundreds to the tens of thousands of credits, depending on the severity of the infraction. The gamemaster should act as the arbiter for assigning monetary penalties.

## Fuel
Fuel for craft and reactors can also range in price, typically dictated by location. The Mining Sector is a better source of lithium for MPDs than the Core Sector, for example. See Chapter Nine: Travel and Trading for more information.

## Docking Fees
Docking fees range anywhere from the hundreds of credits to the thousands of credits, depending on the quality of the docking center and the remoteness of the planet or city in question. See the planetary profiles in Chapter Ten: Setting for more information.

## Maintenance
Annual maintenance and inspections for a craft start at 0.1% of the base value and increase by 0.1% every ten years.

## Salaries
Crew for a craft typically earn 100 credits per week, more for senior crew. Crew, especially for corporate craft, can bargain for more wages or fewer wages.
