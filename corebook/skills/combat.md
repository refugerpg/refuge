Combat skills are the domain of the Soldier, though Aim is a universal skill for all classes.
# Aim
The universal combat Skill, Aim measures the ability of a character to wield, sight and track targets with firearms, as well as his or her general aptitude with ballistic, Gauss or energy weapons.

**Use:** Aim is typically rolled opposed in the midst of combat encounters, though its use in non-combat or unopposed situations can extend to whenever the use of firearms is tested. Use of a firearm in mêlée combat - i.e. a buttstroke or pistol-whip - is not governed by Aim, but by Mêlée Weapons.

**Modifying attribute:** Aim is always modified by Dexterity.
Opposing skills: Whenever Aim is used as an opposed roll, it will almost certainly be opposed by a targeted character’s Dodge skill.

**Modifiers:** As in the real world, being able to successfully engage an opponent is as dependent on circumstancial modifiers as it is on actual skill with a weapon. Accordingly, there are a number of modifiers to Aim.

**Proficiency:** The use of a weapon with which the player is not proficient imparts a -3 penalty to all related checks, while use of a focused weapon imparts a +3 bonus.

**Aimed shots:** Spending AP to line up a shot with a weapon provides a bonus to an Aim roll. On the other hand, firing a weapon without taking the time to aim often imparts a penalty.

**Stance:** Lying prone, crouching, or being in a position conducive to shooting often offers bonuses to Aim (+2 and +1, respectively). Conversely, walking and running generally confers penalties to an Aim roll.

**Targeted shots:** Attacking various parts of a target’s body (apart from the torso) imparts penalties to Aim.

**Cover and concealment:** Concealed targets incur a penalty to any attempt to Aim at them.

Example: Laura, playing as a level 8 Solari Ambassador (Dexterity 4, Aim 8) lines up a shot on an lightly concealed (-2 Aim) enemy countersniper with a battle rifle, spending 6 AP (+2 Aim) to carefully aim at the target’s head (a -3 penalty, to a total of -3). Her Solari Ambassador is proficient in the use of battle rifles and incurs no penalties to its use. Her character is lying prone and receives an additional +2 to Aim (-1). Rolling a 6 on her d10, she subtracts 1 for her Dexterity score and adds 8 for each rank in Aim, before subtracting 1 in circumstance modifiers - for a total of 13.

# Demolitions
The use of explosives - grenades, plastic explosives, dynamite, etc. - are all under the purview of Demolitions. Ranks in Demolitions reflects experience and skill with demolitions and explosives, both in theory and in practice.

**Use (set explosives):** Setting an explosive is an unopposed skill check of the explosive device’s difficulty of use. A professional-quality mining explosive will be more difficult to operate than a pipe bomb.

**Use (thrown explosives):** Unlike other combat skills, the effective use of thrown explosives is generally not dependent on how well a target cooperates with you in getting hit. For thrown items, Demolitions is always an unopposed skill check. The DS for a thrown explosive is equivalent to the distance away from a target in squares. A failed check results in a 1d8 roll. Referencing the chart, the GM determines in what direction the throw went wide or fell short, subtracts the failed Demolitions roll from the DS, and places the grenade that distance in squares from the target point. Before the grenade explodes, all characters in the blast radius must make a DS 10 Awareness check. A success affords them a reflex action to move out of the way of the blast radius.

**Modifying attribute:** Demolitions is modified by Dexterity. For characters who prefer to think through their use of explosives instead of taking a more touchy-feely approach, Demolitions can be modified by Intelligence with the use of the PLACEHOLDER Abilty.
Opposing skills: Demolitions is rarely opposed by anything other than Demolitions.

**Modifiers:**

Example: Franz (Dexterity 6, Demolitions 4) has bravely run away from his fisticuffs and lobbed a grenade at Jacob, who is eight meters away (DS 16). He rolls a 6 on his 1d10, adds his Dexterity modifier and Demolition ranks for total of 11. The grenade misses. Franz rolls 3 on his 1d8 roll - the grenade falls to the right of his target. With a 5-point difference between the target roll and the actual roll, the grenade falls 5 meters to the right of Jacob, possibly still including Jacob in the fringes of the blast radius. Close does indeed count in horseshoes and hand grenades.

# Unarmed Combat
Unarmed Combat represents a character's experience and skill in unarmed combat, as well as a character's knowledge of unarmed combat forms and maneuvers. Ranks in Unarmed Combat give characters access to combat techniques, and convey bonuses to attack, defense, damage or some combination of the three
Use: Unarmed Combat is almost always used as a standard opposing check, though whenever proficiency in Unarmed Combat maneuvers or techniques are tested, this skill is used.

**Modifying attribute:** Unarmed Combat is usually modified by Constitution. Characters opting for a more finesse-based approach can be modified by Dexterity through the use of the Finesse: Unarmed Combat Ability.

**Opposing skills:** A character defending against an opponent using Unarmed Combat can use whatever approach they wish - be it with dodging (Dodge), mêlée weapons (Mêlée Weapons) or another Unarmed Combat roll.

**Modifiers:** Unarmed Combat Techniques (cf. Chapter Five, Abilities & Traits and Chapter Seven, Combat) are used to modify Unarmed Combat rolls.
{{% example %}}
Example: Franz (Constitution 4, Unarmed Combat 6) is faced with yet another ill-advised fisticuffs. He Charges 2 meters toward his opponent - a 3 AP action - and brandishes his fists. Taking a heavy swing (4 AP), he rolls 3, adds Unarmed Combat (for a total of 9) and Constitution modifier (for a total of 8) and hopes for the best.

# Mêlée Combat
Mêlée Combat governs a character's ability to effectively use edged weapons - swords, spears, axes, knives - and blunt weapons - maces, clubs - in combat. While mêlée weapons have largely fallen out of popular use by the time of the Refuge Role-Playing Game, many are still in use by the impoverished, the desperate and those who favor engaging targets with an advantage in close quarters.

**Use:** Mêlée attacks with weapons specifically designed for close quarters, as well as mêlée attacks with firearms - buttstroking, pistol-whipping - are governed by Mêlée Combat, generally as opposed rolls. Demonstrating a fancy flourish would be an example of an unopposed Mêlée Combat roll.

**Modifying attribute:** Mêlée Combat is modified by Constitution. For characters who use mêlée weapons with more finesse than sheer strength, Mêlée Combat can be modified by Dexterity instead of Constitution with the Finesse: Mêlée Weapons Ability.

**Opposing skills:** A character defending against an opponent using Mêlée Combat can use whatever approach they wish - be it with dodging (Dodge), other mêlée weapons or making an Unarmed Combat roll.

**Modifiers:** Mêlée Combat Techniques (cf. Chapter Five, Abilites & Traits and Chapter Seven, Combat) are used to modify Mêlée Combat rolls.
