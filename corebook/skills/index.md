The vast majority of conflict resolution in the Refuge RPG is performed with skill rolls. Attacking, defending, lock-picking, piloting - whenever these routine events appear in gameplay, a skill roll will be involved. Skills and skill points represent fields of study or aptitude, and the amount of time and experience a character has invested in each field of study.

With skill rolls seeing quite a bit of use, perhaps it’s for the best that the majority of skill rolls are very simple—d10 + the relevant skill + whatever attribute score modifies the skill.

# Skill groups
Each class is closely associated with one group of four skills - one universal skill, and three non-universal skills. All skills are available to all characters, but only skills within a class’s particular group of skills are guaranteed as class skills.

* Soldiers have [Combat Skills](/corebook/skills/combat/) that dictate actions and successes on the field of combat.
* Scouts have [Finesse Skills](/corebook/skills/finesse/), skills that require grace, dexterity and celerity.
* Supports have [Fitness Skills](/corebook/skills/fitness), skills reflecting individual aspects of strength and constitution.
* Techies have [Intellectual Skills](/corebook/skills/intellectual) requiring particular intense academic study or intellectual focus.
* Spacers have [Environmental Skills](/corebook/skills/environmental) that improve their ability to survive in the hostile environments of the future.
* Ambassadors have [Social Skills](/corebook/skills/social) that dictate the success and varieties of social interactions commonly encountered in the Refuge RPG.

# Universal, class and non-class skills
As mentioned earlier, each skill group has four skills, one of which is universal (for a total of six universal skills). The other eighteen are are non-universal skills. Any skill points put into a universal skill by any character, regardless of class, increase that skill by one rank.

Non-universal skills can be sorted further into the categories of class and non-class skills, depending on the character. Class skills also increment with invested skill points on a 1-to-1 basis. Non-class skills require two points to increase by one, but are not otherwise subject to penalties of use.
The number of class skills a character receives on character creation is dependent on a character’s Intelligence attribute score.
Further class skills can be chosen by the selection of the appropriate Class Skill Trait.

# Skill progression
Every level a character receives a certain number of skill points to invest in his or her skills. This is dictated by the character’s class. The maximum number of ranks a character can have invested in any one class skill skill at a given level is Level + Intelligence modifier, with a minimum of 1 per level. The maximum number of ranks a character can have invested in any one non-class skill at a given level is equal to their Level.

# Opposed and unopposed rolls
There exist two different types of skill rolls in the Refuge RPG. The first, and probably the most commonly encountered, is the opposed roll. Simply put, an opposed roll is one resolves conflict between two agents acting in opposition to one another. This manifests itself in a single skill roll on each side; either the same skill is rolled, or a countering one instead.
{{% example %}}
d10 + (Skill + Attribute Modifier) + Miscellaneous Modifiers  vs. d10 + (Skill + Attribute Modifier) + Miscellaneous Modifiers
{{% /example %}}
Generally speaking, the opposed roll is made by the GM - an NPC enemy’s defense roll, for example - though in instances where two player characters engaged in some kind of opposing action, opposing rolls between player characters are to be expected.

Example: Natalie Halsey is crouched in the shadows, waiting for an enemy soldier to move past her. With a Stealth skill of 12, an Agility modifier of +2 and a d10 roll of 6, the enemy soldier would have to muster a combined Perception roll of 18 of greater to detect her.

In other instances one character is acting in opposition to a more quantifiable obstacle. Perhaps a character is attempting to break into a secured computer system—instead of assigning the computer attributes and skills, setting a semi-arbitrary value for comparison to a character’s ability to perform in the relevant skill suffices. This roll typically takes the following form:
{{% example %}}
d10 + (Skill + Attribute Modifier) + Miscellaneous Modifiers vs. Difficulty Score
{{% /example %}}
A general idea of difficulty scores in comparison to character level and setting is below. Setting difficulty scores of 50+ for level ten characters is unrealistic if one hopes the players to have any chance of success, while forcing level fifteen characters to face repeated checks of 4 or 5 would be tedious for everyone.

# Critical successes and failures
Sometimes the quality of the attempt matters more than a character’s innate skills and talents. In such extraordinary cases, a critical success (or failure) may determine the outcome of a roll. Rolling a 10 or 1 on a skill roll sets up a potential success or failure, respectively. The player then rolls another d10 - a second 10 imparts a critical success and a second 1 a critical failure.

## Critical successes
A critical success always counts as a success, regardless of character skill ranks, circumstances, or defender success (except for a spectacularly-unlikely opposing critical success, which then results in a tie). It’s up to the GM to create a suitable explanation for the occurrence - perhaps a character simply made an extremely good educated guess on their Knowledge roll, or felt the gentle hand of fate guide the barrel of the rifle half a degree to the right.

## Critical failures
A critical failure is - surprisingly enough - always a failure, regardless of character skill ranks, circumstances or opposing rolls. Once again, it’s up to the GM to create a suitable explanation for the occurrence and to come up with an appropriate penalty for the bad roll. Sometimes that penalty can just be failure, but it may very well be more spectacular  if the GM desires.

# Skill descriptions
The remainder of the chapter describes the various skills available to characters in the Refuge RPG. Skills are displayed by category - with the universal skill first, followed by the other skills in alphabetical order.

**Use:** A lengthier description of the skill’s usage in gameplay. For skills with multiple uses, more detailed explanations of their uses will be placed here.

**Modifying attribute:** Most skills rely upon a single attribute score. Other skills have alternate key attributes; these are available upon the selection of an appropriate trait, which will be given here.

**Opposing skills:** Many skills have opposing skills, skills that generally show up as countering rolls. Whether or not a skill is typically used opposed or unopposed will be indicated here, along with the opposing skills.

**Modifiers:** Some skills have circumstantial modifiers, and are uniquely affected by status effects, Assistance, or something as mundane as a character lying prone or standing up. These circumstantial modifiers will be indicated in this section.
