Soldiers in gameplay
Soldiers as PCs: Soldiers are the quintessential combat class in the Refuge Role-Playing Game. With new combat abilities almost every level, a fairly high number of Action Points and high HP and Assistance, Soldiers are extremely well-optimized for combat situations. However, their skills are almost exclusively dedicated to combat, and their opportunities to branch out are extremely limited.
Soldiers as NPCs: Soldiers appear frequently in campaigns as thugs, military grunts, police, guards or the generic enemy combatant.
