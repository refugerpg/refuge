description: Fragile speedster, master flanker.

The scout is concerned with fast-paced harassment, being capable of inflicting serious damage at close range before disappearing. Their speed restricts scouts to all but the lightest armor, and minimizes the amount of damage theyâ€™ll be able to take before going down permanently.
