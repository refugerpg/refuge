Everyone has their own niche—things they prefer to do, given the choice. In the Refuge universe, this is no different. There are six base classes in Refuge—Soldier, Scout, Support, Techie, Spacer and Ambassador. Each one of the base classes is most closely associated with one of the six character attributes, and the roles they play in the Refuge Role-Playing Game are tied to these strengths.

While these strengths and weaknesses can be reinforced by the class system, there is no rule dictating that characters adhere part-and-parcel to the stereotypes their classes fulfill. There’s nothing prohibiting a Scout from investing time and effort into being able to withstand more than a few pistol shots, nor is there anything stopping an Ambassador from becoming particularly gifted with a shotgun: the class system is a mere starting place for characters in the Refuge universe. Where they go after that is up to you.

Upon completing quests or vanquishing foes, characters receive experience points that represent their relative level of accomplishment in their chosen field. A level-one Soldier has likely just graduated from basic training and has yet to see the front lines, while a level-twenty Soldier is a grizzled veteran, with a vast wealth of experience in his or her field.
Given a certain level, finding the experience required uses the following formula:

Each class has a brief description of its role in a given campaign, and its relationship with the other character classes.

**Key Attribute:** Each character class has a primary Attribute score. This determines their strongest dependent score, as well as their skill set. Each class also has several secondary Attribute scores that work well with the class’s role in a party.

**Abilities:** Abilities are prominently featured in combat as different attacks, defenses and techniques a character is able to use. This is dictated by the class’s key and secondary attributes.

**Action Points:** Action Points dictate the number of actions a character is able to undertake in the midst of combat.

**Hit Points:** A character’s Hit Points specify the amount of damage a character is able to take before succumbing to his or her injuries.

**Skills:** Skills are focused fields of expertise. There are six universal skills available to each class, and three other skills that are initially limited to specific classes.

**Traits:** Traits reflect aspects of characters’ personalities and offer bonuses and extended options to a character’s non-combat actions.

**Morale:** All characters contribute points to their

# Talent trees
All classes have four talent trees, one for each of the class’s skills. These talents confer bonuses in power and variety to the use of these skills. Every level a character can choose a new talent from the talent tree, provided its prerequisite talents have also been selected.
