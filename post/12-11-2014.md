title: Dev Diary (12-11-2014)

---

There hasn't been an altogether huge amount of progress made recently, but it's been long enough that it's definitely worth a dev diary to talk about some of the bigger changes to the Refuge ecosystem.

## The Gunnenator

This is more of a tangental note to Refuge which, as a sci-fi RPG, will not be making heavy use of modern-day weapons, but it's important for the development of the game, seeing as I now have a much better handle on how game stats would correspond to real-world weapons. The Gunnenator is an interface for converting real-world gun specifications to game stats for a game of your choice. Want to give your Inquisitors an AK? You can. All through the magic of Angular JS.

The repo is [here on GitHub](http://github.com/refugerpg/gunnenator), and you can use a live demo [here](http://noahlange.com/gunnenator).

## Turn calculator

This is a bit of a longer-term project, but it's something I'd like to have done before I do any more extensive play-testing. I've started work on a web-app that allows its users to quickly stack together actions to calculate the necessary die rolls for a turn. Why is that helpful?, you may ask. Well, it might be for some people, because some people hate math, and don't want to add together modifiers for their characters.

## Morale
