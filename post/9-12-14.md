excerpt: "I've been struggling to think of a good platform for the Refuge RPG for a few years now. I've thought about using Drupal's OpenAtrium and experimented with a wide variety of other little platforms, but nothing's really jumped out at me as a viable solution. Obviously .pdf's and a print book are desirable, but considering that the mechanics are currently in-progress, it's a little premature to be working on more conventional print solutions."

I've been struggling to think of a good platform for the Refuge RPG for a few years now. I've thought about using Drupal's OpenAtrium and experimented with a wide variety of other little platforms, but nothing's really jumped out at me as a viable solution. Obviously .pdf's and a print book are desirable, but considering that the mechanics are currently in-progress, it's a little premature to be working on more conventional print solutions.

So that brings me to Hugo and static site generation. I really started look at it as a solution yesterday, and after trying out Jekyll and not being thrilled with it, I started working with Hugo based on another recommendation and it's really fantastic. Pretty much does everything I want it to do without surprises.

Of course, there are a couple things that aren't perfect, but that's what you get whenever you don't write your own software. And I'm not nearly a good enough programmer to pull something like Hugo off by my lonesome.

So we'll see how this goes.
