The core of the Refuge Role-Playing Game is the character, and the core of the character is his or her class. Each of the six attributes is associated with one base class—Dexterity for the Soldier, Agility for the Scout, Constitution for the Support, Intelligence for the Techie, Perception for the Spacer and Charisma for the Ambassador.
The class offers base values for a character’s dependent scores, tagged skills, well as starting armor and weapon proficiencies, a special ability and a selection of special talents to improve a character’s abilities in each of their fields of expertise.

Classes
-------
There are six core character classes in the Refuge RPG, each depicting a character archetype to fill a unique role in group dynamics.

Skills
------
Each character has access to a variety of different fields of expertise, ranging from firearm handling to dodging attacks to hacking computers. From the twenty-four skills, each character is considered ‘trained’ in the six Universal skills as well as the three other skills dictated by his or her class, with the opportunity to train in other skills. 	Skill rolls are made by rolling 1d10, adding a character’s invested ranks and adding an attribute modifier (the full modifier is added for trained skills; no points are added for untrained skills).

Abilities & Traits
------------------
Abilities and Traits offer other means of character customization - Abilities are generally combat manuevers and techniques that offer particular bonuses or situational abilities, while Traits are aspects of a character’s personality that manifest in stat bonuses or simply offer additional role-playing opportunities.

Talents
-------
Talents are specializations within each skill, allowing players to tweak their characters toward particular proficiencies. Talent selection is limited between character classes. Talents are granted and assigned at the gaining of a new level.

Action Points & Hit Points
--------------------------
Action Points and Hit Points reflect the extent of actions a character is able to undertake during a given combat round and the amount of damage a character is able to withstand in combat, respectively. AP and HP are static after character creation, excepting one-time upgrades through selected Traits.

Morale
------
Group morale is dictated by the sum of each of its members’ morale scores. As members are injured, rendered unconscious or killed, group morale drops accordingly. Ambassadors can use their class abilities to affect morale of their own or other groups.

Progression
-----------
Upon reaching a certain experience level, characters have access to new Abilities, Traits, Talents and points to invest into their Skills. Every five levels a character gains one point to invest to his or her Attribute scores. The amount of experience required to reach a given level is calculated by Level<sup>2</sup> &times; 25.
