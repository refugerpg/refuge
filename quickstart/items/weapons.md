Pistols, assault rifles, knives, swords, craftboard cannons - all are tools used to wage war. Kinetic weapons are still, by and large, the arm *de jure* of the twenty-ninth century, and widely available to military forces and civilians alike. The vast energy requirements of energy weapons and their extreme size make them most useful as craftboard ordnance, where they do see some small-scale deployment.
Weapon Characteristics
----------------------
Weapons have a number of statistics that determine their performance.

- Attack:  This number represents a combination of the time needed to chamber, sight and fire a single round, burst or short interval of automatic gunfire
- Aim: The Aim cost of a weapon represents the total time  (in AP) needed to accurately aim a firearm at a target. Both the weight of the weapon and its sight radius affect its Aim cost.
- Reload: Reload cost measures the length of time it takes to replace a firearm’s empty magazine or battery with a new one.
- Mêlée: Mêlée cost is the amount of time needed to successfully strike an enemy with the firearm itself.
- Draw: Draw cost is the time it takes to draw a weapon from its holster and prepare it for firing.
- Accuracy: Weapon accuracy is measured in two values, separated by a slash: base accuracy and maximum accuracy. Base value is the accuracy of a weapon fired at the hip, or in a more casual firing position. Maximum accuracy is the accuracy of a deliberately aimed weapon.
- Rate of Fire (ROF): Rate of fire indicates the cycling rate for a burst of automatic gunfire—that is, the maximum number of rounds expended during a single attack action.
- Damage: Damage measures the amount of physical trauma that results from a hit by a weapon’s fire.
- Spread: Spread measures the severity of a weapon’s recoil during a burst of fire.
- Range: Damage decreases by one die at every increment beyond the stated Range.
- Capacity: Capacity measures the default number of rounds a weapon is able to fire before having to be reloaded. Magazine size can be easily expanded via weapon upgrades or the use of extended magazines.
- Weight: Weight measures the weight of the firearm in question, contributing to a character’s carry weight as well as dictating the damage done with a mêlée attack (1d4 per kilogram, rounded up).
- Cost: This measures the cost of the weapon for purchase, either new from the manufacturer, distributor or individual, or previously used, from a third-party. This varies widely depending on weapon manufacturer and any restrictions that may be placed on its sale.
