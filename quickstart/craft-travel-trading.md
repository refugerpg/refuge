Craft Attributes, Scores & Skills
=================================
All craft have the same six Attributes as characters, as well as their dependent scores and each of the six Universal skills.

Acquiring & Financing Craft
===========================
For the purposes of this Quick Start Guide, the details of commissioning and purchasing craft will not be expounded upon. Instead, utilize the chart below for information about craft for purchase prices.

There are other ways to acquire craft without purchasing them. Characters can steal craft, have them on loan from an employer, or receive them from mysterious benefactors. This is largely up to the GM. For characters who wish to purchase a craft, a ten percent downpayment is standard. The following is a formula for calculating monthly payments P on a loan of L credits for n months at a monthly interest rate of c is as follows:

Operating Costs
---------------
Operating a craft is not cheap. Here are some of the variety of costs that may be incurred over the course of a craft’s operational lifetime.

- Food: 2.5 kilograms of food is required per crew member per day, .5 kg of it frozen, 1.5 kg of it dry and .5 of it fresh, at a total cost of 6.5 IFS credits/day.
- Fines: Any number of unlawful actions may incur the displeasure of the IFS or local governments, resulting in fines ranging from the hundreds to the tens of thousands of credits, depending on the severity of the infraction. The GM should act as the arbiter for assigning monetary penalties.
- Fuel: Fuel for craft and reactors can also range in price, typically dictated by location.
- Docking Fees: Docking fees range anywhere from the hundreds of credits to the thousands of credits, depending on the quality of the docking center and the remoteness of the planet or city in question.
- Maintenance: Annual maintenance and inspections for a craft start at 0.1% of the base cost and increase by 0.1% every ten years.
- Salaries: Crew for a craft typically earn 100 credits per week, more for senior crew.

Weapons and Systems
===================
Power & Capacitors
------------------
All craft have a power rating, dictating how much they can do in a given amount of time before expending active power stores. This is the craft’s AP score. Capacitors have stored power reserves that can be spent to augment a craft’s AP score for a turn. These do not regenerate in combat, making them invaluable for making AMD jumps.
Heat Sinks
----------
Using power and performing actions expends heat. As heat builds up past the sinks’ capacity, crew make Survival rolls against the heat every turn. Every point of heat above a craft’s HS score imparts another 2 points to the Survival DS. Crew who fail are Exhausted. The effects of Exhaustion stack each round they fail the check.
Travel & Trading
----------------
Most of the money to be made in the tramp trade is in voyage charters - transporting goods and passengers on behalf of a charterer.

Different planets have different amounts of usable natural resources and different populations. These effect purchase and sale prices of goods.

Few crews with the financial resources, money can be made in buying, transporting and selling bulk goods. Some trade goods are of dubious legality and will have to be transported with care.

Other goods are required for the daily operation of the craft and survival of the crew.
