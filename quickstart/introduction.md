Five hundred years after humanity fled a devastated Earth, the IFS has begun to crumble, losing ground to the criminal syndicates, ruthless corporations and new autocracies on its fringes. 	Impassively, the exies wait as their longtime oppressors’ federation collapses. The fate of humanity has never seemed bleaker. 

Welcome to Refuge.

The Refuge Role-Playing Game was designed to be relatively easy to pick up for RPG veterans and beginners alike. The following should serve as a brief guide to creating characters, selecting Abilities and Traits, putting points in Skills and getting started in general.

Dice
----
You’ll need several d4, d6, d8, d10 and d12 dice. The number of dice to roll is prepended to the dice value. Rolling a d4 three times is signified by 3d4. Anything after - adding, subtracting, etc. - is used to modify the roll.  Rolling a d4 three times and subtracting two is signified by 3d4-2. 	The primary roll for the Refuge Role-Playing Game is 1d10.

Using Skills
------------
Skill rolls are used for most everything in the Refuge RPG - from combat to social situations. The number of skill ranks a character can invest into skills is dependent on his or her Intelligence Score and his or her class - one rank per point for tagged skills, one rank per two points for non-tagged skills. 

To use a skill, roll 1d10, add the character’s skill ranks, and then the relevant Attribute modifier. There are two basic rolls in the Refuge Role-Playing Game: the opposed roll and the unopposed roll. 

An opposed roll requires two agents in contest. Both characters in an opposed roll make a roll. Whoever has the higher roll after adding Skill ranks, an appropriate Attribute modifier and miscellaneous modifiers wins the challenge. In the case of a tie, the defender wins. 	An unopposed roll requires one agent in contest with an obstacle, either natural or artificial. In this case, the GM sets a Difficulty Score to the roll, which the player must meet or exceed in order to succeed

Classes & Progression
---------------------
See the chart at the bottom of the page for information about classes. 	Upon reaching a certain experience level, characters have access to new Abilities, Traits, Talents and points to invest into their Skills. Every five levels a character gets one point to distribute to his or her Attribute scores. The amount of experience required to reach a given level is calculated as follows:

Character Generation
--------------------
1. Roll 3d4-2 six times and assign each result to an attribute score of your choice. This is where having an idea for a class in mind is a good idea.
2. Apply the species modifiers to the Attribute scores.
3. Select a class.
4. Calculate your dependent scores, based on your Attributes and your class’s and species’ own values.
5. Choose Abilities, Talents and Traits.
6. That’s it. Play.
