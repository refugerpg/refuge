Combat in the Refuge RPG can be divided into skirmishes and craft combat, that is, combat between human or exie fighters, and combat between spacecraft. Much of the ruleset is shared between the two; general rules and any special considerations that must be made for either will be listed here.

The following are the (abbreviated) rules for infantry combat.

Skirmishes
==========

Initiative, AP & Reflex Actions
-------------------------------
At the beginning of a combat round, each combatant commits to a series of actions they are going to perform. Each player rolls d10 + Agility for initiative, and actions are evaluated in initiative order. Ties for initiative are broken by each character’s Agility score, and subsequent ties are broken by 1d10 rolls. 

Ambushers get to choose among themselves who goes first; the ambushed and late joiners join at the end of the round. 

Action Points are the currency of combat. Spend them to move, attack, and perform other actions. Some actions provoke Reflex Actions, during which a character can use up to half of their turn’s AP as a free action. 

See Reference & Gamemastering for a chart of actions, their AP costs and situations granting Reflex Actions.

Rolls & Modifiers
-----------------
Most actions taken in combat (apart from movement) involve skill rolls of d10 + Skill + Attribute modifier + situational modifiers. 

Movement and stances often apply bonuses and penalties to combat skills. See Reference & Gamemastering for a stance chart with AP Costs and the Cover & Concealment tables. 

All weapons have base accuracy and maximum accuracy. For each AP spent aiming, the attack roll receives a +1 bonus to Aim. The aiming bonus remains through the rest of a character’s turn unless the character performs an action that would reorient the weapon. 

Another hit is earned for each bullet fired in a single attack, every time the difference between an attack and a defense roll exceeds a weapon’s Spread score. Firing multiple times within a turn imparts a penalty to attack. Each subsequent attack takes a penalty equal to a weapon’s Spread score to the attack roll. 

Range also effects attack rolls. Each subsequent range increment imposes a +1 penalty to accuracy. 	Attacking a particular part of an enemy’s body impart penalties to attack. See Reference & Gamemastering for a Hit Locations table.

Damage & Hit Locations
----------------------
For every hit earned against an enemy, roll for damage. Damage is indicated on the weapon table and should be recorded on the character sheet. Damage decreases by one die for each range increment. Any damage resistances are subtracted from the attack depending on its type. Damage dealt to the head is suffered twice.

Suppressive Fire
----------------
For characters with the Suppressive Fire Ability, suppressive fire as a full-round action is a viable tactical option. The attacking character makes a single attack roll with no aiming bonus on a circle with a diameter of 3, 5 or 7 squares, depending on the ability rank. All characters in the target circle must Dodge. A successful roll pins the suppressed character to a prone position. A failed roll hits the suppressed character and then pins him or her to a prone position. 

Any attempt to break suppression requires a Willpower roll vs. the suppressing character’s Aim roll. A failed roll results in the character remaining prone. After a successful roll the suppressed character makes a Dodge roll to avoid the fire, and a further success allows them to move and operate normally.

Overwatch
---------
Characters with the Overwatch Ability are able to spend half their turn’s AP in watching down a sightline. When an enemy moves into the sightline, the character has the option of using the other half of their turn in making an action of their choice.

Morale
------
At the beginning of a combat encounter, morale is calculated (for the player characters, this will not change dramatically between encounters) for each group of opposing combatants by adding each character’s morale score together. 

As characters are rendered unconscious or killed, the group’s morale drops accordingly, and the points they contributed to their own morale pool is redirected toward the opposing force’s. Individuals in groups with low morale suffer penalties to their skill rolls.

Example
-------

Maire Jensen (Scout 5) is in a spot of trouble. Trapped a hangar with a pair of hostile, stimrunning thugs and armed only with her trusty Thensi SMG, things don’t look good. 

An enemy Support leans out from behind a crate and lets out a tear of suppressive fire. He rolls 10  (8 + Aim 7 + Dexterity mod. -1 + -4 LMG base aim penalty). Maire musters the willpower to weather the burst, rolling a 15 (9 + 6 Willpower + Intelligence mod. 0). With such a high Dodge score, (Dodge 7 + Agility mod. 3) she is able to avoid the burst of suppressing fire by default. 

She sprints behind a nearby shipping crate (-7 AP), leans out, (-2 AP) and aims for a moment (-1 AP, +1 Aim modifier), and carefully squeezes of a burst at the enemy Support. (-4 AP). She rolls a 6, adds her Aim +8 and Dexterity mod. of +0 and subtracts the -3 accuracy penalty for a total attack roll of 12. 

The enemy Support is a slow, lumbering fellow. He rolls a 5, adds Dodge 3 and subtracts a -1 Agility mod. for a total of 7. As her Aim roll exceeds the defender’s Dodge roll by her weapon’s spread score (3), she earns another hit. 	The submachine gun does 3d12 damage; Maire rolls 4 + 9 + 12 = 25 and 6 + 7 + 9 = 22. The Support’s heavy armor (+30 Ballistic) negates the first shot, but with the damage stacking vs . She’ll need something a little heavier to deal with him.

The enemy Soldier waits at his position and sets up overwatch, waiting for her to step out from behind the crate: he gets to use the other half of his turn at a point of his choosing.

The Support lets up on the suppressing fire and ducks down, receiving total cover. With no visible targets and a Soldier waiting for her, Maire unclips a grenade from her belt and throws it between the two soldiers. The point she throws at is 10 meters away, requiring a Demolitions roll of 10 to hit precisely. She rolls a six, but without Demolitions as a class skill or any invested points, she receives only half her Dexterity modifier for the throw (luckily for us it’s zero, so we don’t have to do any calculations). Rolling 1d10 for miss direction, the grenade lands four meters to the left of where she intended, right at the feet of the Support. 	With 5d20 points of Shock damage from the high explosive grenade, the enemy Support takes 28 damage. (16 +3 + 15 +12 + 12 = 58 - 30 Shock DR = 28. Counting from the inside to the outside, this also inflicts 12 damage on the enemy Soldier, who merely shrugs it off.) 

Twenty-eight damage kills the Support outright. The eight points of morale contributed by the Support to their morale pool is removed, leaving the Soldier demoralized and suffering a -1 penalty to all further checks. Maire, on the other hand, is bolstered by her foe’s demise and receives a +1 morale bonus. 

Maire sprints with her 10 remaining AP to the crate before the Support’s shattered corpse, but the Soldier strikes from his waiting position. He rolls a 16 (8 + Aim 5 + Dexterity mod. 4 - morale 1), and Maire fails to dodge the initial shot, but he misses with the rest of his burst. He rolls 6 + 5 + 2 + 7+ 8 = 28. Maire’s light armor absorbs 15 points of the damage, but she takes 13 points of damage to her HP. 

Looks like things just got worse...
